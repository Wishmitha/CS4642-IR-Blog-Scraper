  "content": "If you visit\nyou can see a bunch of statistics about YAMU's performance, which we're now making public\nYou can see how many people visit our website, how many people use our app, how many times our videos are watched, etc.\nOur web stats have always been public and that never hurt us. Now we're just making more information available.\nWe think it may be interesting for people looking to advertise, or for people just interested in YAMU as a business. That, of course, includes competitors, which we're fine with.\nI don't know when you're reading this. Visit our stats page and\nNote that you can't see the most important metric - sales. We're working on releasing that information soon, once the sales team starts using the damn system.\nSome graphs do go down. A big reason a hidden variable you\nsee - sales.\nGrowth can slow down while (or because) revenue is going up, which means the company is still going in the right direction. We're working on releasing our sales stats as well, basically as soon as the sales team starts using the damn system.\nThere's nothing especially embarrassing or dangerous in these basic statistics. Competitors can generally find each others metrics somehow, and we're generally proud of our performance.\nWe also think it's helpful for other startups and small businesses to see as much 'real' data as possible, besides the usual inspirational and always positive stories most companies present about themselves.\nOur stats go up and down. We hope you enjoy the ride.\n",
