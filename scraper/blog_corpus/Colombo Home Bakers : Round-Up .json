If we missed anything, please comment and let us know.\n\nThese bakers aren't exclusively cupcake or brownie bakers - some of the ones in the cupcakes sections make brownies too, and so on, but we've just marked them according to what we think they're best at.\n\n\nSo after much face stuffing, that's our round-up. If we've missed anyone, please let us know in the comments section and we'll give them try.\n",
