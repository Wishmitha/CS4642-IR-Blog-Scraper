This is actually harder to answer than you\u2019d think because there\u2019s a lot of deals and offers floating around. So, we put together a curated list of spots for different dining occasions, whether it be for a family sit down, dinner date, or even for larger groups.\nSince first opening up two years ago, Rare at the Uga Residence has been one of our top picks for fine dining in Colombo. They\u2019ve got a sophisticated menu that they consistently execute well, making them a great choice this season for couples looking to celebrate something special, as well as for anyone looking to entertain family and friends visiting during the holidays to something a bit special.\nOneUp is a top contender for our \u2018favourite new restaurant of the year\u2019 title. So their addition to this list is no surprise. They\u2019ve been excellent on each of our visits with impeccable service to boot. If you\u2019re looking for a casual spot to meet some friends, grab a cup of coffee, or just have a really good brunch, OneUp is a must-try. They\u2019re also sure to introduce some Christmas inspired dishes and drinks in December for those looking for something festive.\nA lot has changed since the time we first reviewed Asylum three years ago. They\u2019ve really stepped their game up over the last year, introducing a bunch of new dishes along with breakfast and brunch. Their seasonal card deals combined with their daily happy hour from 5 pm - 8 pm make for some significant savings for those looking to grab a drink. Asylum has also become quite popular for their weekly salsa/bailando night and regular themed events, making them one to keep an eye during Christmas and NYE.\nChristmas is one of the best times of the year to check out hotel restaurants since most of them will either have their seasonal buffets, deals or both. OZO\u2019s rooftop bar\nstill offers one of the best views in the city and they\u2019re sure to have a seasonal buffet at\n. If you\u2019re more of a brunch person, they recently began serving\nas well and the best part is that you can order \u00e0 la carte (unlike most other hotels) and you get pool access, which is usually only for guests.\nFriday\u2019s hasn\u2019t tried to change too much since their launch four years ago, and it\u2019s a decision we support. That\u2019s not to say they haven\u2019t changed at all. Over the years they\u2019ve made progressive improvements to their dishes and added a few welcomed budget options as well. One of our favourite new additions is the bacon topped ribs which is a pork lover\u2019s dream. It\u2019s also got this really cozy vibe which would make it perfect for a family dinner during Christmas.\nUnlike the larger hotels in the city, Colombo Courtyard generally takes a more low-key approach to most of their seasonal offerings. So you\u2019re not going to find a massive buffet here. However, if you\u2019re more on the lookout for something a bit more private, CC is just the place for you. Whether it be lunch at\n, dinner at\nor drinks at\n, Courtyard has something for anyone looking to avoid a large crowd.\nFew hotels in Colombo do F&B as well as Kingsbury does. Although it\u2019s not the biggest property, Kingsbury has managed to cater to pretty much every palette between\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\n. They usually have their seasonal menus out around early December so it\u2019s definitely worth dropping in, especially if you have nothing too specific in mind, since you\u2019ll likely find something that fits.\nWith their most recent cafe opening up on Marine Drive, Tea Avenue has been slowly expanding both their reach and offerings. While they still have their signature drinks like the Ferrero Lavish, what we\u2019re excited about are their seasonal tea blends which should be available soon. Their Barnes Place cafe is also just a really great place to chill and enjoy a cup of tea.\nPSM is what really put Park Street on the map for most people. Now with four other contemporaries just a stone\u2019s throw away, Park Street in itself is a great option for a seasonal dinner or drink meet-up. What we really love about Park Street Mews Restaurant is just how consistent they\u2019ve been over the years. The space looks great after dark and it\u2019s one of the few places we\u2019ve been able to recommend every year without fear.\n",
