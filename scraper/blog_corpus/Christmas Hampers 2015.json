There are lots more, but here\u2019s our list of popular and easy options when you want to pamper with a hamper!\nThese sites all offer pre-packaged hampers that can be delivered both locally and internationally. They\u2019re smaller and more personal, so are good options if you live abroad and want to send something for family or loved ones.\nThe delivery website\u2019s hampers are mostly practical seasonal collections of dry rations and groceries like sauces, cookies etc, and the range is pretty limited. It\u2019s a little bit pricey given the stuff that\u2019s actually inside, but if you live abroad and want to send something useful to people in Sri Lanka over the season, it\u2019s handy. They also have normal grocery hampers around the year.\nAnother option that allows you to send gifts to Sri Lanka or within Sri Lanka, lankagifts.com has prices in both USD and LKR. Their hampers are a little more varied than Kapruka\u2019s, with a range of chocolates and imported edibles. They\u2019ve also done a wide range of hampers, that focus on different themes like chocolate or wine or even pasta.\nSendit.lk is a relatively smaller company (or so we assume, as we haven\u2019t heard too much about them), but their hampers look reasonable and have plenty of options to choose from. Again, these heavily feature groceries and such.\nThis site has an entire section devoted to Christmas Gifts that can be sent to and within Sri Lanka, from hampers and chocolates to cards and flowers. Lanka Food\u2019s variety is good, but their site is archaic and kind of difficult to use. We couldn\u2019t actually open the detailed sections of hampers, so that\u2019s a huge minus.\nPretty much all of the island\u2019s top supermarkets do a neat selection of Christmas hampers.\nArpico\u2019s got a sleek new tab on their FB page dedicated to this year\u2019s hampers. They\u2019re also offering a lot of card discounts and quantity discounts, along with free delivery within 5km of outlets. With their variety, reliability, and discounts, it\u2019s looking like one of the best options this season. Their hampers are obviously stuff that you\u2019d find at their supermarkets, and the more expensive ones include a fair bit of premium alcohol. We think Arpico\u2019s hampers are probably one of your best options this season.\nWith a massive variety of 16 different hampers, all named after Christmas carols, Keells has cornered the market in reasonable hampers again. The basic hamper includes stuff like a packaged Christmas cake, jams, and other nibbles. The more expensive hampers include stuff like imported cheese and pasta along with a set of 6-10 bottles of imported liquor. Visit any of their branches or check out their site to buy them directly on keellssuper.com\n\nCargills and Laugfs are yet to launch their hampers, but we will update this list when they do!\nPretty much all of Colombo\u2019s upscale and 5 star hotels do posh, boozy, and expensive hampers for people out to impress. This year, very few are doing ready-made ones, leaving it to you to choose your own components.\nTo get a Hilton hamper, you\u2019ll have to go to Fine Things (the dessert place near their lobby), and have a look through their existing list of options. They will wrap and deliver the hampers for you, with delivery within 20km of the hotel charging anything from Rs. 700 to Rs. 1,500. Goodies cakes and cookies are generally stellar and pricey, and there\u2019s also plenty of upmarket alcohol you can add on.\nThe Kingsbury has 3 categories of ready-made hampers, at Rs. 20,000, Rs. 25,000, and Rs. 30,000. It\u2019s not cheap, but neither are the well-curated edibles inside the hamper. They all have Christmas cakes and puddings, along with wine, cheese, and other delectables. They\u2019re also offering a bunch of goodies at their Gingerbread House, with the a whole selection of cakes and desserts. For a comprehensive list and to place an order, give them a visit or call on 0771087720.\nThe Cinnamon Grand isn\u2019t doing any readymade hampers this year, but the Goodie Hut is offering personalised hamper baskets. Again, you\u2019ll have to go over there and order according to their existing Christmas menu. They have the usuals like cake, pudding, and cookies, but they don\u2019t do delivery, and will charge Rs. 1,500 for packing and wrapping. Probably not the best deal going, but Goodies\u2019 desserts are usually great so it might be worth a shot.\nThe Taj is doing two lovely and superbly expensive ready made hampers this year. One is Rs. 38,000 and the other is Rs. 48,000. They both include decadent components like a bottle of Mo\u00ebt\nThis list should get you started if you're in a hurry to kick off the season, but we'll update it with more that we hear about, try, or enjoy soon!\n",
