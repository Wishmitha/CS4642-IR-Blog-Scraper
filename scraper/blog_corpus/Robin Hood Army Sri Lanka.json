  "content": "Not all superheroes swoop down to rescue people from burning buildings, or save damsels in distress (not that damsels need saving FYI). Some superheroes rescue food. Food recovery is the practice of salvaging edible food that would otherwise go to waste. The rescued food is then distributed to those in need. In most cases, the recovered food is perfectly edible, but not sellable.\nThe Robin Hood Army are just normal people, like you and me, who are keen on saving surplus food to place it in the hands of the poor who struggle to make ends meet, people who cannot afford to place three meals on the table.\nIf you\u2019re a restaurateur, supermarket supervisor or a farmer who is against throwing away food, there\u2019s probably a food recovery organization near you willing to pick up your extras and we would like to point you to one in particular.\n(RHA) is a volunteer-based organization that collects surplus food from restaurants and delivers it to the less fortunate. The Robin Hood Army originated in India and has spread its operations to many cities in South East Asia.\nThe RHA works to get surplus food from restaurants across to the less fortunate people. In Sri Lanka, they distribute meals in and around Colombo and have played a role in providing meals to those who were affected by the floods last year. RHA's vision is to eliminate hunger and food wastage globally.\nIf you are an owner of a restaurant, join the fight to end hunger by filling in\n.\nMore than a third of all of the food that's produced on our planet never reaches a table. It's either spoiled in transit or thrown out by consumers in wealthier countries, who typically buy too much and toss the excess. This works out to roughly 1.3 billion tons of food, worth nearly $1 trillion at retail prices.\nAside from the social, economic, and moral implications of that waste\u2014in a world where an estimated 805 million people go to bed hungry each night\u2014the environmental cost of producing all that food, for nothing, is staggering.\n\nContact:\n.\n.
