We at YAMU have often dwelled on the nature,\n, not to mention their\nHere are some of the thoughts we have while we're riding around in one!\n.God bless Google Maps. Honestly. Praise the Lords.\n. Why are tuk fares so expensive? Please, I have limited funds.\n. Torn between \"damn, I'd love to see a Tuk race.\" and \"Cool it, Vin Diesel. This isn't Fast 8.\"\n. The meter runs during traffic, which means you're basically getting charged for traffic. In the immortal words of King Julian \"move it, move it.\" Please.\n. Yaaaaaas the open road.

Take it easy on the speed bumps, I'm quite sure my organs just rearranged themselves.\n. No Uncle, I don't want to talk to you.\n. Is red, blue and green the default tuk colour?\n10. Are we there yet?\nThis last one I got from\nbut is 100% relatable.\n\n",
