Even if you don\u2019t expressly do so, we all end up thinking about how we want the new year to be different. On this list we\u2019re not telling you which resolutions to make for yourself. Instead, these are a few things Sri Lankans could change to would make life a lot more pleasant for the people around them.\nAt this point we Sri Lankans are almost proud of being consistently late for just about everything. Like literally any function. If a group of Lankans show up for a gathering thirty minutes late, you\u2019ve actually lucked out. It\u2019s so bad that we call it \u201cSri Lankan Time\u201d. If you actually want people to show up at a certain time, you\u2019ve got to tell them to show up about an hour earlier so that they turn up on time. But yeah, let\u2019s all try to be a bit more punctual in 2018.\nGetting around in Colombo is more frustrating than ever, especially during rush hour (which is more like three hours). The worst part is that if you look around you\u2019ll see that most of the cars have one person in it. Combine this with the ever growing number of bikes and tuk tuks and you end up with the the nightmare that is Colombo from 5 pm - 8 pm. For 2018 let\u2019s try to work with colleagues to carpool so that more people travel together and save time, parking and fuel costs. Alternatively, we\u2019ve got services like PickMe who\u2019ve improved their technology and operations, making them a viable daily option.\nAs far turn-offs go, bad breath is right up there and we Lankans are frequent offenders. This is actually not due to particularly bad dental health, but rather because of our cuisine. We use so much onion and garlic in our curries and malungs that we inadvertently end up with bad breath. Speaking from experience, try to avoid meetings directly after lunch time \u2018cause you\u2019re asking for trouble. Obviously carrying a toothbrush and paste to work is a pain, and while drinking enough water after eating will help a lot, something like a mouthwash will help cut out any odour completely.\nHere's a resolution that you may have made in previous years, but ended up putting off to the next year. OK, lame joke. But procrastination - habitually and consistently delay tasks - is a problem that plagues about 20 percent of the population worldwide, and about 80% of the Sri Lankan populus (I\u2019m making this up but you know it\u2019s for real). Sri Lankans are skilled and very resourceful but we\u2019re also incredibly lazy. Like if we can put something off for later, we will put it off for later. All jokes aside though, something as simple as a making a list of tasks to complete for the day can help get out of this habit and significantly improve productivity.\nSri Lankans are known for our incredible hospitality and that\u2019s true (for the most part). However, we have a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde complex when it comes to the internet. As of late comments sections on Sri Lankan websites and Facebook have become incredibly toxic, making online interactions quite unpleasant. While anger at certain instances are understandable, we\u2019re seeing a lot more name-calling and arguments based on conflicts of opinion. This could be on politics, sports and even food (we know this better than anyone). Internet arguments rarely solve anything and in the worst of cases can be detrimental to your occupation so let\u2019s try to be a bit nicer on the internet going into 2018. Hell, you can just not comment, which also works brilliantly.\n",
