So I can buy a Macbook Pro! :D\nGiven that this is politics, not everything was about shopping lists. It's sad, but it's also funny.\n\nCanada to build a wall to stop American refugees from crossing the border! Trudeau will make America pay for it.\nYup.\nFrom the first black president to a president endorsed by the KKK !\nmaking lighthearted but completely believable references to one of former president Rajapaksa's more hilarious election campaigns.\nMorally, ethically and multiple time financial bankrupt US Presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s divisive campaign sunk to a new low last evening when he rolled out a look-a-like candidate R Sirisena, mirroring the same tactic employed by former President Mahinda Rajapakse.\nDespite all the entertainment, we're not completely oblivious to the eff-ups of our government. (Allocations for education has been slashed in half, while more funds have been granted to My3's office and for the telecom sector. #Yahapalanaya, but we've time to cry in despair about that soon after we finish enjoying the drama that's unfolding in the USA. It's rarely that we Sri Lankans get to watch another country go through almost exactly what we went through during our last elections).\nMeanwhile, My3 & Ranil to Ravi, \"Yako, patas-gaala, apey budget allocations increase karapang. Everyone distract-wela with Trump\"\nAh well.\n\n",
