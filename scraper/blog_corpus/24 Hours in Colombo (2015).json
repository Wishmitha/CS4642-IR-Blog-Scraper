That's when kids get out of school and Colombo traffic becomes a soup until about 2:30 PM.\nShops are open during the day, but try not to be on the road during schooltime, as mentioned above.\n\n\nIf you're in Colombo for just 24 hours, you need to catch the sunset, preferably\n. Beyond that, there's plenty to do around the city at night.\nWe won't get into nightclubs (try Clique or Amuseum or Kama if you're into that). These are places to chill and get a drink, hopefully with a view. Note that most of the posher places require men to wear long pants and shoes to enter.\n",
