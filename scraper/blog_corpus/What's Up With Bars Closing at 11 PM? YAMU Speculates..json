Everyone's suffering, and everyone's confused. There's been no coverage in the papers and no official Government dictat, so us Scooby Doo types at YAMU decided to investigate.\n\n\nAccording to the Excise Department's woefully outdated website, the permit fees per hour for private establishments selling alcohol are Rs. 250 an hour. Seeing as this website was probably curated last when the Portuguese still colonized the island, it's no longer relevant. Until recently, it was Rs. 5000 per hour. Not too pricey, that's like a fraction of what most bars/ restaurants would make a night.\nPost bra-flinging debacle, it appears as though the price has been firmly hiked to Rs. 75,000 flat after midnight (we've heard). Why?\nIt's been borderline impossible to find out what's actually going on. Bar/ nightclub owners are being understandably cagey, and the GoSL Excise Department won't even answer their phones (and a couple of their numbers were actually disconnected). Here are our wild speculations in the face of colossal lack of information.\nWe're sorry if we haven't helped at all. All we can factually tell you right now is that your usual watering hole may close by about 11 or 12 PM, but we hear this whole situation is hopefully going to be resolved within the next couple of weeks. Holla at us if you know more than we do. Happy partying!\n",
