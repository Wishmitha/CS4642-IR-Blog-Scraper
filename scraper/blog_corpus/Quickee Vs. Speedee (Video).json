  "content": "Once there was only one place to get quick delivery of rolling papers, condoms, kottu and whatever else a modern lover might need. That was\n. Now, however, one former\nrider has started his own company, called\n. Who's the best?\nBoth have quite similar menus and service offerings, so it kinda breaks down to which is faster and more accurate. So we tried them both out, placing the same order at the same time. You can see the results in the video below.\nTo test out the services we tried the same order:\nWe placed both orders at the same time, but got off the phone with\na bit quicker, thus the race began.\nDespite torrential rains outside, the newcomer\narrived first, within 38 minutes. Janith initially thought they got his order wrong, but we looked at the tape and he actually did order a sandwich, not a sub. All his complaining should have been about himself.\nSo basically,\ngot the order perfectly and delivered it fast.\nThe defending champion lost here, arriving 19 minutes later at 18:42. It took\na full 57 minutes to deliver our order. The order was accurate, but quite a bit slower than the competition.\nThus for this round of #Versus, we must crown\nthe victor. They delivered faster and better than\n. Much faster. Note that this is just one try on one day so results will vary. Let us know what your experiences are like. Both are innovative services and hopefully competition will make them better.\n",
