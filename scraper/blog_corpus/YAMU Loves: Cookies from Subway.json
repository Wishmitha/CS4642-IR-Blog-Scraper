People flock to these cafes and restaurants to try the desserts, the cafes are happy, cavities are had, dentists make money: it's a win-win situation really. But of course how many places have we come across so far that actually serve up a good, chewy cookie?\nAside from the bourgeoisie bakeries that cater to the dessert connoisseurs, or the quirky cafes that dish out dry cakes, in a sudden turn of events the Perfect Cookie resides quietly atop a glass shelf on the counter of nowhere else but Subway.\nI know. I was shocked, too.\nThey've got three types of cookies that are roughly the size of your palm and are on sale for Rs. 100. It's safe to say that these are probably mass-produced without being tended to by the loving touch of an in-house chef, but what to do. [\n]\nAs long as the taste buds are happy and you get your money's worth there's nothing to cry about.\nI suppose this post is blasphemy in the eyes of every culinary god in existence and I offer my sincerest apologies, but que sera sera. Next time you head down to Subway for all that healthy goodness, try a cookie.\n",
