  "content": "Cinnamon grand, being the social hub that it is, has become one of the \nmore frequented high tea spots in Colombo. Their spread is decent at \nbest, but the fact that's it's a buffet adds value.\nHigh\n tea is a relatively new trend here in Sri Lanka, at least for the \nmasses. Nowadays pretty much all the major hotels offer their own take \non the midday classic. Cinnamon Grand's high tea happens\non\n. It's priced at\nper head, which puts it\n somewhere in the middle of the price spectrum. While most\n other places stick to a menu, Cinnamon does a high tea buffet. The \ncatch though is that their spread isn't the most impressive. That being \nsaid, the fact that you can stuff your face will appeal to some.\nThe Cinnamon Grand high tea is held at the Tea Lounge, which is the right past the fountain through the lobby. It's actually not a very large area, so we highly recommend calling them on\nand making a reservation. One thing we appreciated was that they have live piano music which adds to the atmosphere.\nSince this is a high tea buffet, it's mostly self service. The waiter that brought us our tea was fast and attentive, well spoken and professional. One thing I didn't quite understand was why they needed so many managers on the floor.\nCinnamon Grand's high tea has its merits, but they need to step their game up in terms of variety and selection if they want to compete with the best high teas in town. We'd give it a 3 out of 5.\n",
