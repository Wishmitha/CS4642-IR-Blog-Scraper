We have constantly been deceived by pretty \u00e9clairs that taste like chocolate flavoured cement mixed with sadness. When will this travesty end? Where do we find that perfect \u00e9clair? Does it even exist?\nThese questions bothered us so much we launched The Ultimate \u00c9clair War.\nWe hopped around Colombo to hunt down the best \u00e9clair in the city, and the contenders were -\nGreen Cabin's \u00e9clair didn't blow our tastebuds away. It was your basic bakery \u00e9clair with a really soft choux pastry and super sweet chocolate cream filling. It tasted a lot like the icing on their chocolate cake. So, chances of the filling being their mass produced chocolate icing are quite high.\nKlassy's \u00e9clairs have been satisfying in the past. This time around, too, we couldn't really complain much besides an overdose of chocolate via the filling and icing combined. The soft choux pastry coupled with extremely decadent chocolate is not for the faint hearted (and diabetic).\nIt was a well established fact that their \u00e9clairs were the bomb. But it is with deep regret, remorse and sadness that I inform you these didn't taste as great as they used to. The pastry was a little hard, the filling tasted of margarine and on the whole, they didn't taste too fresh.\nHere's hoping this was just one unfortunate experience and they get back to making their amazeballs \u00e9clairs ASAP!\n\nDespite succeeding at getting airy and soft pastry, there was no distinct taste coming through. It wasn't sweet either, and that completely contradicts the whole point of making an \u00e9clair. Plus this presentation was...uninspiring.\nFor Rs 145, you'd expect more than a mere thin chocolate coating atop very hard pastry. The filling, on the contrary, satisfied us with enough chocolate, but definitely not worth the monies.\nFor Rs 50 you're not really getting an \u00e9clair. You're paying for a hard pastry filled with icing sugar with a hint of chocolate topped with a thing chocolate coating.\nCheap, but definitely not worth buying.\nThis was the prettiest \u00e9clair of all. The pastry was slightly soft and the chocolate coating was decadent. However, the filling felt a lot like a sugary icing you'd top a cupcake with, and that didn't work too well for our liking.\nThe choux pastry was alright - neither soft nor hard. The filling was basic chocolate icing and the top was basic chocolate.\nIt was average.\nFor a ginormous price, you'll receive a ginormous \u00e9clair that calls for sharing. The filling inside tasted richly of Nutella, but there's just SO MUCH of it. Besides the extra generous filling, the \u00e9clair on the whole was soft with the toasted nuts adding a little crunch now and then. If you love Nutella and \u00e9clairs, you'll be in for a real treat.\nThis \u00e9clair looked quite appealing but it was an average, insanely sweet \u00e9clair that didn't really stand out.\nBiting in to this felt like trying to take a bite of Sigiriya rock. The extremely hard pastry had a filling that looked brown enough to remind us of chocolate (and other things, if you're creative and slightly disgusting), but it didn't taste of chocolate. Weird and bad tasting, this is an \u00e9clair that is best avoided.\nSoft choux pastry with a filling that had a mix of both custard and icing, topped with rich chocolate and nougat, this tasted heavenly. Unanimously, this \u00e9clair was crowned the winner in this mellow, chocolatey battle. At Rs 200 this lands on the pricey posh end of this French pastry spectrum, but was it worth the money? HELL, YEAH.\nBased on our experience, Cravings is the new (yet pricey) spot to sate our \u00e9clair cravings.\n",
