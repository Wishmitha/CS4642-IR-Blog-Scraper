  "content": "Deciding who to go to before getting inked is huge. It's a serious business \u2014 is the ink good? Is the artist's hand steady? Are they reliable? Will I get Hepatitis C?!  We asked around and compiled a short list of places recommended by people (and Facebook too, sorry). Judging from the feedback and responses they've gotten, these tattooists seem pretty reliable.\nIf you're looking for artists and starting prices, this will help you out.\n(\nRs. 3,000\n\n: Dot work, line work, and shading.\n\n077 220 4104\n: Rs. 7,000\n\n: Watercolour\n\n077 724 2234\n: Rs. 2,500\n\n: Freehand, Polynesian\n\n: 077 167 2872\nRs. 5,000\n\n(Didn't specify, and asked to check his work out on his page, instead. Pretty much an all rounder, and does really fine line, minimalist, and intricate work)\n\n077 188 9799\n: Rs. 1,500\n\n: Graywash and black work. They also seem to have metallic inks.\n\n077 768 1626\nRs. 2,000\n\n(Also didn't specify, and asked to check his work out on FB/IG instead. Seems to do a lot of black inked work, mostly Polynesian and shadings)\n\n071 241 3159\nHappy inking and make sure to always ask for fresh, sterilized needles!\n",
