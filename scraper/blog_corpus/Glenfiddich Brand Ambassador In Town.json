It's a beautiful drink, and one with a rich history.\nBut don't take my word for it. Glenfiddich is bringing their brand ambassador Struan Grant Ralph down to Sri Lanka to host a series of events. He is a trained chemist, bartender and above all a story-teller, plus he has an impressive beard.\nHe's hosting two events which you can still get tickets for, and one which is invite only. Since the enjoyment of whisky is very much in the mind, the more you know about it, the tastier it is. This is a wonderful opportunity for Sri Lankans to learn.\nThe historic Galle Face Hotel has played host to royalty (both crown and cinematic), and it's now playing host to some of the world's favorite single malts. Glenfiddich and their Global Brand Ambassador, Struan Grant Ralph in collaboration with the Galle Face Hotel's Chef Adam Gaunt-Evans, will be pairing malts with an exquisite dinner.\nThis exclusive fine dining event is only upon invitation.\nGalle Face hotel hosts the Glenfiddich Global Brand Ambassador, Struan Grant Ralph, during his first ever visit to Sri Lanka. Following an exquisite malt paired dinner, Struan, will conduct a spectacular bar show.\nBook your space with the Special Events Desk on 0777 222 135.\nPersonally, Glenfiddich and it's other brand Balvenie are my favorite whiskies.
