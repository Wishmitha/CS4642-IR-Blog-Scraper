  "content": "If you've looked up in the last year, you know what the Colombo Lotus Tower looks like. It looks like this:\n\nBut what does Colombo look like\nthe Lotus Tower? The building is meant as an observation tower, but since construction has slowed down, we seem to be a long ways away from observing anything. Luckily for us, we found some photos from the construction site, including a few shots from the crane. They're amazing:\n\nWhat a view, right? You're towering above the Beira Lake and the city is laid out in front of you.\n\nHere you can see the view as you're walking along the crane, with the Port cranes in the distance.\n\nFinally, they say don't look down, but here it is, the view down the crane.\nWhen they finally finish it, there'll be an elevator, and hopefully a restaurant. We can't wait. Until then, thanks\n, and all the anonymous users keeping it real.\n",
