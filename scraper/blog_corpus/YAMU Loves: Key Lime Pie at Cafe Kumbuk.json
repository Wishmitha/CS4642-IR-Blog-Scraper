Especially their Key Lime Pie, which Dili and I fell instantly in love with.\nThe pie is really simple, with a biscuit base and immensely fluffy yet creamy body. It's like a cross between a custard/ condensed milk topping and lime-spiked cream. The cream literally just melts in your mouth \u2014 there's a contrast in textures and flavours, as at first you don't really taste anything and then the citrusy tang kicks in, rather subtly. And then there's lime peel in bits of it which adds a stronger tang, and then you get the base which gives a more solid grounding to the whole thing.\nThis is pretty much the only place in Colombo where we've found a lime pie, and one which we love at that. While this\na YAMU Loves, heads up that the preparation can be inconsistent and we've sometimes been underwhelmed by it. We've had both good and lukewarm experiences \u2014 the good one leaving us craving for a lifetime's worth of Key Lime Pies, and the bad one merely not living up to our previous experiences but still being good nonetheless.\nThere are three layers, with the middle one being what seems to be\nat\nSo for Rs. 400 you basically get a fluffy, frothy, custardy top layer, super soft soaked cake middle layer, and the crusty biscuity layer. Heaven? Heaven.\n",
