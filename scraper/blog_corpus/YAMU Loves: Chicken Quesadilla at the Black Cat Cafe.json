The latter depends though, as I've had this dish around thrice and the sauce options differed several times. It has consistently been accompanied by what seems to be a home-made tomato sauce though, which is delicious.\nThe quesadilla comes piping hot, the tortilla is crispy and light, the filling actually stays in and doesn't spill out, and it's surprisingly a very hearty meal which would be enough for two people if you weren't starving as there are four heavy slices. The carrot and cabbages used in the coleslaw were intensely fresh and had a nice crunch to it, and it wasn't slathered in mayo enough to make it wilt. The thing about Black Cat is that they don't overdo things \u2014 the meals are simple, but with high quality ingredients and great execution so it strikes the right balance in just about everything (especially portion size and the blend of flavours).\nOverall, we really do like this. At Rs. 800 it definitely is expensive but the quality and taste of the dish justifies it: you do get value for money.\n",
