The fest's got a lot to entertain, spoil, and treat you, from wicked beats to sleek design, and a wine list to sip ever so slow. Here are our favourite stalls and nibbles to look out for:\nHand-created women and menswear from the slick designers at PR are going to be on display at the\nsection, including classic favourites like\nsunglasses,\nand\n, along with fresh new names like\n. You'll also find a selection of Good Market designers present, including the ever-funky\nupcyled collection.\nDancing, drinking, and shopping are great, but they're also tiring as all hell. What you really need is a perfect little mid-jazz getaway. Head to\ns pop-up spa, and indulge in a lavish soak, foot rituals and more.

And you're going to get to experience it over a stunning weekend of international music and incredible dining. Oh, and did we mention sunset barbecues?\nGet swinging, get sipping, and we'll see you there!\n",
