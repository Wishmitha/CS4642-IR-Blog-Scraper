It's a time that brings families together and highlights the best that our culture has to offer.\nSo here's a handy timeline of all the auspicious times for the Sinhala & Tamil New Year for 2018.\nHowever you celebrate or don't celebrate Avurudu, we hope it's a time of peace and togetherness for you. And kiribath.\nPlease share food with your neighbors of all castes and creeds, drive safe, and don't be a fireworks statistic.\nHappy Avurudu from everyone at YAMU. We'll see you on the other side.\n",
