With piles and piles piling up.\nLast week, we wrote on how to reduce wastage. This week we are focusing on reuse and upcycling. If you didn't already know, there are people and places engaged in this type of work. One such place is the\n(CFM). You can give your old stuff a new lease in life by reselling them at the CFM. The CFM is the place for you because as they say one man's trash is another man's treasure.\nFounded in 2014, the CFM hosts their events on a monthly basis and encourage and advocate for the reuse and up cycling without trashing them. If you have a collection of items, you could either hand it over to the CFM or sell them at a stall and make a buck out of all what you consider junk.\nThe benefits of recycling are manifold. It prevents pollution. Reduces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. You save your pennies. Reduces the amount of waste that will need to be recycled or sent to landfills or pile ups and allows products to be used to their fullest extent.\nIf you are a buyer, the CFM would be a treasure trove with a whole variety of items sold at a very minimum cost. If you\u2019re throwing out too much with the trash we recommend this strategy: reuse and upcycle. Follow their pages,\nto educate ourselves on how to reduce waste through recycling.\nOn your part, with a little creative thinking, you too can come up with a list of household items you could save, reusing, recycling and upcycling - than tossing it out in the trash.\n",
