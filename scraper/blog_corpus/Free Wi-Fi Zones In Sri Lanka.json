  "content": "It was announced this week by the Prime Minister that 26 parts of the country have been turned into free Wi-Fi zones. Epic news. These zones are spread out in Colombo, Kandy, Matara, Galle, Jaffna, Ratnapura, Polannaruwa and Hambantota. Here's a breakdown of where exactly.\nWe went to a hotspot at Colombo Racecourse to see how it works. First, each area has a hotspot run by someone else - in this case Dialog. So we had to look for 'Free Wi-Fi Dialog'\nOnce you're in it's pretty slow - about 0.5 Megabits per second, compared to 10 Megabits per second on our office Dialog 4G line. This speed, however, is enough for email and some basic web browsing. It's not good for video.\nIn the Fort area, there's free Wi-Fi at\n,\nin Pettah,\n(three places whose frequent large crowds are going to be very grateful), the private and public Pettah bus stations, the Fort railway station, and the Sri Lankan Police Headquarters.\nThe Law College in Hulftsdorp also has free access.\nIn Colombo 7, the\n(yay), the Colombo Public Library and the National Museum have Wi-Fi.\nBattaramulla and Dehiwala also have a free Wi-Fi zone each - at\n, and for some reason at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.\nSo this is as godayata-magic as it gets. First the highways and new malls, and now this - here's to more pleasant surprises in the future and to hoping these zones have a good internet speed.\n",
