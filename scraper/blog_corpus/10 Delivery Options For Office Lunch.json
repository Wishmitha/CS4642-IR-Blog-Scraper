Here's some of the most reliable options we've come across that have always helped the situation.\nAK is probably our most regular delivery options here at YAMU HQ. They\u2019ve been consistent with both the food and the delivery times. There\u2019s been some drama about AK\u2019s delivery lately, but we haven\u2019t really come across any serious issues. They\u2019re minimum delivery order is Rs. 750 so you\u2019ll need a convince a couple of mates to order as well, but if you make your case they\u2019ll sometimes deliver one item.\nHazari\u2019s is another Middle Eastern restaurant that\u2019s got their delivery game on point. It\u2019s actually a surprisingly small operation but they\u2019re very efficient and reliable. If you\u2019ve got 4 or 5 people their full rotisserie chicken which is outstanding for Rs. 1150. Besides that they even have their own take on rice and curry along with a bunch of other rice options.\nWe\u2019ve got a bit of a love-hate relationship with Naniyori. On one hand, we love their bento options which offer the best value for money Japanese. On the other hand, they regularly  take over an hour to deliver, which is really frustrating if you don\u2019t order early. Steamboat, their Chinese / Thai counterpart, also does delivery and we\u2019ve heard good things about their Thai executive lunch.\nJapanese food delivery choices are still limited, and while Kami Maki isn\u2019t the best Japanese around, they do a pretty good job of delivery. Like Naniyori, their reasonably priced with a respectable selection of Japanese staples. We\u2019ve had  their katsu rice dishes delivered in the past and found it to be quite satisfying.\nChinaman is a brand new Chinese delivery restaurant. We can\u2019t really speak for consistency at this point, but our recent order came in around 40 minutes which is pretty good. They also have a bunch of set menu options which come in classic chinese take-out boxes which is both easy to eat in and dispose of.\nLet\u2019s be honest, Fast food franchises still offer the most efficient delivery services, and McD\u2019s is our pick of the bunch. They\u2019re minimum order amount is only Rs. 500 and they\u2019re generally very fast. And if you\u2019re pulling an all nighter at the office, they deliver up until midnight.\nIf you\u2019re not in the mood for rice, Paan Paan\u2019s got a great range of pastries, subs and even some pretty fresh salads. They don\u2019t have their own delivery, but you can place your orders either through Quickee.lk or Foodie.lk. Unlike other restaurants most of their stuff is already ready to go so it shouldn\u2019t take too long either.\nHealthy Living were one of the pioneers of the healthy food movement in Colombo and the best part is that they deliver. They\u2019ve expanded their menu and now offer bunch of variations including rice and curry, a few Thai dishes and salads. However, You\u2019ll need to to place your order before 10 AM since they deliver all the orders together.\nSticking with that healthy theme, Calorie Counter is the other option we recommend. They serve up some restaurant quality dishes which have been pretty consistent from our experiences. They deliver both through Quickee and Foodie, but we suggest ordering about an hour in advance since certain dishes take longer to prepare.\nYes, we know it's cliche, but they have always been reliable with delivery. Apart from the pizza, they've also got some rice options like the Birizza. If you're really hungry and you want food really fast, this is the way to go.\nLet us know what's worked best for you in the comments.\n",
