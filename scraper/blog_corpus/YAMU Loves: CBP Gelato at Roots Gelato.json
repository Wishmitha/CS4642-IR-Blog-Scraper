So you're probably wondering what could be better, right?\nCBP Gelato!\nYup. That's a thing.\nhad a CBP flavor before and while that wasn't bad, it definitely wasn't something memorable, nor was it addictive.\nNow they've teamed up with Bellissima to create one of the best locally inspired gelato flavors. Roots Gelato has been a bit of a hit or miss overall, but this is as good as it gets. The key here is the ratio of CBP to Ice cream and the texture of the chocolate itself. They've done an incredible job of combining the chocolate in the Bellissima CPB and the chocolate ice cream into one cohesive mix. It's incredibly chocolatey with a gooey texture and an abundance of crunchy Marie biscuits embedded in it.\nIf you love CBP as much as we do, you should totally give this a try. It's available at both Gelato outlets in Majestic City and Crescat. At Rs. 350 a scoop it's great value for money and you get enough to fill you up, but it's sure to make you go back so, whoops!\n",
