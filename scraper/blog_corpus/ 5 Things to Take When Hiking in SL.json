Our resident hiking specialist, Buddhika, has been at it for years and we\u2019ve even got a pretty\nfor those looking to get into it.\nHowever, other than the more straightforward trails, the best locations like\nand\nwill take you through some rough terrain. Here are a few handy things (besides the obvious stuff, duh) to take with you the next time you\u2019re heading off the beaten path.\nDuct Tape is an absolute must have when you attempt the more arduous climbs. It\u2019s especially true here in Sri Lanka since there aren\u2019t \u2018hiking paths\u2019 per se for most of these difficult spots. This means that wear and tear on your clothes and items are almost inevitable, along with other unfortunate events like cracked water bottles and damaged tents. Duct tape works as an inexpensive all in one fix that\u2019ll save you a lot of frustration. It\u2019s also excellent at preventing shoe cuts and blisters.\nThis is something we at YAMU swear by for multiple reasons. At face value Axe Oil is a decongestant which works wonders when you\u2019ve got a cold or blocked nose. With nearly all of the hiking trails being at higher altitudes and colder climates, catching a cold is surprisingly easy, especially overnight. Just dab a bit of the oil on your forehead and along your nose before bed to both help you sleep and keep the system clear.\nOn top of that, leeches are also a (yucky) factor when it comes to the greener locations but a rubbing in a few drops of Axe oil will generally keep them (and other insects) away for a few hours. If you\u2019re worried about mosquitoes specifically, citronella spray will get the job done.\nFinding clean water on hikes isn\u2019t always easy. Actually a big mistake made by many drinking from clear water streams and assuming it\u2019s good for drinking. Though not impossible, this  does make brushing teeth a bit of a chore, which makes mouthwash a much easier and faster way to keep your hygiene in check. Besides this mouthwash also insanely versatile as a disinfectant for small cuts and scrapes and even as a hand sanitizer\nCooking during overnight hikes or camps is a nightmare for most since you\u2019re trying to travel as light as possible. This is where instant noodles\u2019 are an absolute godsend. All you need to do is carry a small saucepan with you to boil water. Besides this, eating peanuts is also an excellent way to staying full and keep your energy up throughout a hike.\nResealable or ziplock bags are a must have when you\u2019re heading out for a hike. Getting packaged biscuits and food are a common practice when travelling, but if you\u2019re dealing with stuff like chips, there\u2019s a lot of air those packages that take up space. A simple hack with this is to transfer all packaged dry foods into resealable bags, and since it\u2019s airtight you can even take some precooked food. Another very handy tip is to also store your phone in a resealable to which will make it mostly water proof in case rain breaks out.\n",
