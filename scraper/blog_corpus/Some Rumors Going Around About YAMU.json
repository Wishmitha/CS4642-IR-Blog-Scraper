  "content": "Recently we've been hearing a few rumors around Colombo.\nNo. Our lives would be a lot easier if we did, but we never get paid for reviews. You cannot pay for a good review, nor can you pay to have a bad review removed, or anything like that.\nMost publications in Sri Lanka\npay to play - places advertise and they get a fluff review done in return. We don't do that. Just read our reviews. We publish what we think and deal with angry phone calls and actual death threats in return.\nIf someone claims that YAMU is taking money for reviews, it simply isn't true.\nWe review anonymously and no YAMU writer will ever try to get free stuff from a restaurant.\nWriters get all of their expenses reimbursed and there is no reason for them to cadge free food or special treatment. In reviews what we try to experience is the average experience, which generally means going in and dining and paying like everyone else. Our writers won't lie about where they work if it comes up, but they don't volunteer that information either.\nIf someone out there is being an ass and claiming to be from YAMU, they're probably not from YAMU. Let us know if you hear of anything like this.\nFor more on how YAMU works, please read our\n, or don't hestitate to call us, email or drop by the office.\n",
