  "content": "Affordable and reliable,\nis one of our favourite go-to spots! It's a tiny\nkadey which gives great value for money. The food will also remind you of your mom's curries, unless your mom's a bad cook.\nThere's a wide variety of vegetable curries to choose from and it's never the same because, when the pots are empty, they are refilled, but with different curries.  All curries and\nare well spiced, taste good and act as proof that a plate of rice & curry makes for an absolutely majestic meal. The fish curry (except for the\ncurry), however, is raging with bones and is best avoided.\nWith everything priced at Rs 230 and under, you're given the liberty to choose the type of rice (red/white) you require and 4 vegetable curries, in addition to your choice of meat. For vegetarians, the number of veggies springs to 5. If you want an additional veg curry, you'll have to pay more, but the lady who runs it is very nice and rarely charges the extra amount. So smile and pray you won't be charged for your additional veg curry.\nThis is really more of a takeaway spot, so the seating space is quite shoddy with 2 plastic tables and about 10 chairs housed under canopies. You're likely stumble upon a cat - one that isn't very shy and will keep meowing for more rice when fed once. So, feed with caution, or just don't part with your meal because rice and curry isn't a luxury meant to be shared.\nGiving you a real\nfeel, this\nkadey will give your bank balance a break. Good food, reasonable pricing and a taste of home make Lantheruma one of our favourite spots.\n-\n-\n-\n",
