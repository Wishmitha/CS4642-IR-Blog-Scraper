  "content": "Avurudu is a wonderful time where most of Sri Lanka shuts down and restarts again, in matching outfits.\nIt's a time to go back to your roots, to be with family, or just do nothing. If you follow the traditions, these are the specific times to observe.\nSome people come back to work much later, and some people never come back at all.\nHowever you celebrate or don't celebrate Avurudu, we hope it's a time of peace and togetherness for you. And kiribath.\nPlease share food with your neighbors of all castes and creeds, drive safe, and don't be a fireworks statistic.\nHappy Avurudu from everyone at YAMU. We'll see you on the other side.\n",
