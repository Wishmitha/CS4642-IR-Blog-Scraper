Congratulations to all Sri Lankans for holding a free and fair election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, when can you expect election results? We don't know. Last election (2010) the result was known by early in the morning the next day. The Elections Commission website says to start awaiting results at 8 PM tonight (Thursday the 8th Jan) but the Commissioner has said the final may be as late as Friday evening .\nYou can literally keep refreshing the\n(the official source), but we suspect that site will slow down.\nAda Derana has a\n. You can also check the\n,\nor any of the mainstream media's websites.\nis interesting and independent and will be updating throughout the night as well.\nThe most fun place to be is probably Twitter. Just follow the hashtag\n(just click the link). It's not official or edited (ie there might be some false alarms), but overall you can get news faster and better than anywhere else. In the same way, Facebook or any of your social networks should be transmitting this news in real-time.\nSome credible local and connected journalists to follow on Twitter are\n(BBC),\n(Al Jazeera),\n, and\n(TIME, etc).\n\n\n\n\nMost of the TV/radio stations have apps (just search for their name). There is also a dedicated election tracker this time, which shows only the results. It's called Sri Lanka Elections and it's only available for Android, check the\n. It's free. It pulls the data from the Elections Commission website (how we don't know). We obviously haven't tried it yet, but it looks interesting and may be more efficient than refreshing that website over and over.\nThis is probably the most robust and easiest way to get the news. The Daily Mirror, Derana, radio stations and all major news providers have SMS news services. You can sign up for them using SMS, using the shortcodes here:\n,\n,\n,\n,\n. They only cost about Rs. 30 per month and are generally quite useful.\nEvery radio station will be reporting the election results. You can just listen to your preferred radio station, everybody will cover it. You can stream the radio stations online as well, and most of them have apps. If you check\n.\nEach station also has their own streaming somewhere, but we figure the one source above is easier. TuneIn is an app as well.\nYou can also watch your preferred TV station, though the Elections Commission has\nRupavahini and ITN from airing results for various elections law violations.\nThe safest bet is probably Derana or Swarnavahi or whatever TV station you're used to. In the end they will probably all show the results.\nYou can also stream most of the TV stations online. Most of them also have apps (search your app store)\n\n\nHonestly, it is harder to stay away from the results than it is to find them. The biggest question remains when, but officially stuff should start trickling out tonight.\nThroughout this all we hope that you and yours are safe and well and can enjoy this de facto holiday. If you're hungry we've collected a list of\n. Again, stay safe.\n\n\n",
