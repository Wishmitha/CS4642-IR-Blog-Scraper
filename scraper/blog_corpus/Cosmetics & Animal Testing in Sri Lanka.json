  "content": "The information on animal testing in Sri Lanka is murky at best. There's barely any official communication on the subject, companies are unable (or unwilling) to tell you what their testing policies are, and consumers don't really know how to go about finding out.\nAnimal testing is generally divided into medical and cosmetic testing, where various types of animals from mice to rabbits to beagles are\n. Unfortunately, these methods of testing are often\n,\n. In fact, reports claim that barely 40-60% of tests on animals are accurate.\nThe issue here in Sri Lanka, and about 80% of the world's countries, is that there are no actual specific laws against animal testing. Some other countries (like China, for example) insist that animal testing occurs in order for a brand to sell within its markets so brands that open there have to abide by these rules. There are yet others like India, New Zealand, and most of the EU who have banned animal testing entirely.\nI've found a few local and locally-available brands that don't test on animals, in case you want to update your make up box ethically! If you know of any others, please drop us a comment below and we'll add it on.\nIf you're a hardcore makeup artist or just like your war paint,\nincluding quite a few spots that deliver to Sri Lanka, like ColourPop, Anastasia Beverly Hills or Urban Decay.\nin case you're on the prowl, but you'll be hard pressed to find brands that are cruelty-free, from YSL to Givenchy to L'Oreal (all available here).\nPutting pressure on companies and Governments is usually the smartest way to push policy change. For example, I found this heartening report that\nin labs. In the meanwhile, you can petition the Government to safeguard the rights of animals beyond\n).\nYou can also head to the Body Shop outlets\nForever Against Animal Testing, which will be sent to the UN to request an international convention against the practice. If you've already done one of those things, go ahead and Tweet, Instagram, or hashtag #ForeverAgainstAnimalTesting to get other people talking about it too!\n",
