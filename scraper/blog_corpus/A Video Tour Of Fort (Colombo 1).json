We're starting with Colombo 1.\nColombo Fort is a fascinating place because it's both the centre and the edge of the city. It's technically Colombo's central business district, but after the Central Bank bombing, it shut itself off. A lot of businesses and people fled to the south, to the part of Colombo technically called Thimbirigasyaya.\nFort started opening up with the Dutch Hospital, but there is still a lot of empty and under-utilized real-estate there. More than any part of the city, it's where you can see change happening on an almost daily basis.\nThe time we did this video is actually a unique moment, because in the next five years everything will change. Have a look and tell us what you think of the short film, by Rehan Mudannayake.\n",
