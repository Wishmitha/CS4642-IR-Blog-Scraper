  "content": "For a city with such a multi-cultural community, Colombo has surprisingly few Middle Eastern restaurants. Thankfully though, the few places that we do have are actually quite good. So here's a quick round-up of places to get your hummus fix.\n\n\nAs the name suggests Saffron specializes in Persian Cuisine and they do it really really well. It's run by a couple of Iranian ladies and they serve some \n    authentic Iranian snacks. We didn't get to try their Saffron rice which \n    we've heard good things about, but we liked their shawarmas and sweets. Their mutton shawarmas (Rs. 450) are arguably the best you'll get in Colombo. They also serve up Bamiyeh which is like a Persian doughnut of sorts: soft doughy pillows that have been deep fried in a syrup- yum. We'd really love to see these guys open up their own place.\n\nStartford Avenue is fast becoming a hot spot for eateries in Colombo and Shiraz is one of the more popular restaurants in the neighborhood. Just the look of the place itself sets you up for a very authentic experience with Persian carpets, antique tile art and a \n    collection of beautiful black and white photographs taken by the owner. The food also follows suit with an emphasis on the grilled meats. The only issue is that they're only open for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
