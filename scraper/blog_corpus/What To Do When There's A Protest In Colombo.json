  "content": "Colombo's a city full of angry protests and weary commuters. Protests and traffic-jams are one of the most consistent things about the city, and when combined, they can bring the whole town to a standstill. What can you do when you're caught in the middle of this?\nYou know that Goodreads challenge you've been miserably falling back on? This is as good a time as any to hit the books. There's no excuse to avoid Dostoyevsky now that you've got plenty of time on your hands, or even War and Peace \u2014 because that's how long this commute is going to take.\nI was able to listen to (and enjoy)\nthat award-winning Broadway musical, in the bus. It's 2.5 hours, and I'm utterly grateful of the protestors for presenting me with the time to listen to that beautiful work of art.\nYou'll be limited for space on this one, but you could try out knitting. If not, just download\n: you can then proceed to tell people how you picked up a foreign language in a single commute.\nThere's barely time to socialize anymore because of how exhausting work can be and how busy life suddenly has become. Your social life is clearly in decline/ non-existent, and there's nothing quite like having a good jaw on FB, Twitter, or your preferred mode of SM. Throw shade ambiguously and cry wolf for extra interaction and bonus points.\nYou'll get more time to sleep here than you'll get at home. What else to do, no.\n",
