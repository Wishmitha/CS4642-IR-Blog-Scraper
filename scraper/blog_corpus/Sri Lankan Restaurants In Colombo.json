These are some of our favorites that are advancing Sri Lankan cuisine.\n\nLocal food delivery has always been a popular option, specially among office goers. We've got a few old favourites, along with some new spots that offer larger quantities.\n\n\n\nIf you're going to try one particular dish, it should probably be rice and curry. Most of the restaurants we've listed above do some variation on it (try the Barefoot staff lunch, or the rice packet at JU Udumbara, or the yellow rice at VOC Cafe).
