  "content": "High Tea at the Galadari is quite popular, but it's also nothing to write home about. None of it is bad, and at Rs 1565, it's competitively priced against\nYou get quite a generous spread, so there's value for money working in their favour.\nWith Rs 1,565 all you're signing up for is High Tea, not for special treatment. No one will check up on you until a few minutes after six, when you are impatiently waited on to pay the bill. If you need help, they'd help, but no one is super friendly or excited to see you scoop your fifth serving of Baked Alaska.\nBeige. Lots of beige, gold, brown and cream,so it's warm and cosy. There's also a lot of opportunity for people-watching.\nA wide variety of mediocrity awaits you. What's disappointing is that nothing tastes like it was made in the kitchen of a five-star hotel. E.g. The chicken tikka skewer, on the far left in the picture above, was just chicken meatballs smothered in tikka masala. Why?\nIf you're going to try the sandwiches, you can safely judge them by their looks, because they looked dry, tasted dry and were, in fact, pretty darn dry.\nThe savouries weren't exciting to savour and left much to be desired, because what is life without spice.\nThe situation improves when you get to the dessert spread, with cookies, cakes, tarts, waffles, pancakes and glorious Baked Alaska teasing your sweet tooth. The cakes and cookies were nice and soft, so we were quite pleased! The rest of the desserts were alright as well, but not remarkable.\nDespite their gigantic spread, Galadari has compromised on taste. It's not bad, but it does not wow. However, if quantity is your calling and you're unsure of how to prep yourself for this High Tea, check out our guide on\n.\n",
