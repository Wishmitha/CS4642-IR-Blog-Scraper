  "content": "This is the Sri Lankan match schedule for the T20 Cricket World Cup, 2015, held in India. The timings are great for us.\nThe tournament starts with the associate nations fighting for a spot with the big boys. Then those 10 teams fight for 4 places in the semifinals (2 in each bracket). Then one winner emerges.\nWherein the Associate teams battle it out for two spots in Round 2\nThe proper contests. Sri Lanka matches on the 17th, 20th, 26th and 28th. Ten teams enter, four teams advance.\nYou can always stand outside a TV showroom, but if you have a TV you can catch the match on Star Sports (Dialog TV and PEO TV) or on Rupavahini (terrestrial).\nIf you're looking for places to watch, we'd usually say\n, but they're having some liquor license issues. Until that's resolved, try\n,\n,\nor any of the major hotels.\n",
