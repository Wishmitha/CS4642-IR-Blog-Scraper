Now the issue about all things Sri Lankan is that we don\u2019t generally like to change things once we\u2019ve found a formula that works. But after like 20+ years, it\u2019s about time we changed up our favourite bites with more of a modern twist, in a way that it complements the new drinks we\u2019ve also got.\nWith Uncaged Bites we\u2019ll be looking at a bars and restaurants around Colombo who are doing just that! Each month we\u2019ll feature a classic Sri Lankan bite as well as the new versions around town by some of our favourite bars and restaurants that aren\u2019t afraid to break the mold and come up with some really ambitious bites.\nIf we\u2019re talking staples, grilled chicken is right up there. Not only is it the most eaten meat on the island, it\u2019s also the perfect base for most preparations. The classic preparation is uncomplicated but still packs flavour. The meat is usually cooked on the bone, seasoned with salt and a good amount of ground pepper and then grilled along with saut\u00e9ed garlic and ginger. Pair this with a few veggies or capsicums and you\u2019re good to go.\nRnR\u2019s Garlic Grease Yaka is a true homage to spicy Lankan bites with enough kick to test even the most bonafide spice connoisseur. That being said, they manage to bring on the spice without compromising on the flavour, so even if you\u2019re spice tolerance is just average, you\u2019ll find yourself going back for more through the tears welling up in your eyes.\nThey use thigh and breast meat which they marinate and take straight to the hot plate. While the chicken cooks they throw in a good amount of garlic cloves along with it and prep their signature Nai Kochchi Sauce. The Garlic Grease Yaka is then served up on a sizzling plate along with more chopped kocchi miris (\u2018cause why not?), some onions for crunch, topped off with grilled garlic cloves.\nAt the end what you\u2019re getting is an unapologetically spicy, garlicky grilled chicken which ticks all the boxes you\u2019d want in an uncaged Lankan bite.\nAsylum went with a slightly different approach with their spin on the classic. The Jungle Bite is the classic grilled chicken redefined with a contemporary touch, while still retaining it\u2019s character, flavours and spice. While this isn\u2019t quite as spicy as RnR\u2019s rendition of the classic, it still strikes a great balance of seasoning, textures and heat, which works perfectly with Asylum\u2019s vibe.\nThey start with two whole chicken legs which they marinate in a cocktail of condiments with a few unique flavour enhancers like paprika, mustard cream and fresh thyme. The chicken then goes on a high heat grill to really get that nice sear on outside, before going into the oven for a few minutes to cook through. The chopped chicken is then mixed in with a mix of crunchy veggies like onions, bell peppers, chopped chillies, tomatoes and balanced out with a squeeze of lime juice. All of it is then plated on top of a bed of chopped cabbage and topped with a healthy drizzle of their mint sauce, served along with their signature chilli mayo.\nAsylum actually chose to serve the chicken bone-in, which may sound a bit off-putting to some, but really works since it helps keep the meat moist and tender. It\u2019s a bit of extra work, but it\u2019s well worth the effort.\nAll the different ingredients going into that marinate also really shines through at the end, punctuated by their chill mayo sauce which brings the heat with a welcomed hint of sweetness.\nIn both of these cases the dishes come with two Tiger Beers, and the pairing makes a lot of sense. What most people don\u2019t actually know is that Tiger is actually brewed here in Sri Lanka using a locally inspired recipe to suit the tropical climate. It\u2019s also the go-to beer for street food in countries like Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam so this is no surprise.\nWhen it comes to the Garlic Grease Yaka, you really need something like a refreshing lager to counteract that spice so that you can keep going back for more. Tiger Beer isn\u2019t too heavily carbonated either so you\u2019re not going to find yourself feeling bloated or gassy.\nThe Jungle Bite has a lot of distinct favours going on which you can truly appreciate with the beer acting as a malty, tropically lagered palate cleanser. It let\u2019s you re-experience those flavours with each bite without any real bitter aftertaste.\nWe\u2019ve already tried both of these uncaged bites on more than one occasion and came away really impressed. If you\u2019re a fan of heat and spice, the Garlic Grease Yaka will likely become an instant classic. On the other hand, if you\u2019re looking for something with a lot depth and subtle flavours, the Jungle Bite has a lot to offer. If that isn\u2019t enough reason, both of the dishes come with a Tiger Beer combo deal, which makes it great value for money.\n",
