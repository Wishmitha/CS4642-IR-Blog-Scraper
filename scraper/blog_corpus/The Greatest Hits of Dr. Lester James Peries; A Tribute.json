It was indeed a groundbreaking creation in the history of Sinhala cinema, followed by two more movies;\n(1963) and\n(1964).\nShot entirely outside of a studio, using a single lamp and hand held lights for lighting,\nwas acclaimed locally and internationally. Golden Peacock at the International Film Festival of India, Best Director and Best Film awards at the 1965 Sarasaviya Film Festival are some of the many recognitions it received.\nis a movie that depicts the thoughts and emotions of the newly rich people who lived in the 60s.
