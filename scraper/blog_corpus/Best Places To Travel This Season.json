The season is also generally a great time to travel in Sri Lanka since the weather is pretty tame and there are a bunch of great hotel deals floating around. Here\u2019s a look at some of our recommendations on who should travel where this season.\nThis is a no-brainer in December. The Southern coast really comes alive during the season and the weather is generally quite decent as well. With the recent surge of new properties opening up all the way down to around Hiriketiya, the tourist crowds are also spread out in a way that it isn\u2019t over-saturated.\nIt\u2019s really hard to go wrong here since there\u2019s something for everyone. We'd actually recommend a\nsince there's so much to do, whether it be shopping, eating or just sight seeing. Hikka, Unawatuna and Mirissa are perfect to catch some waves and beachside parties, while Weligama, Hiriketiya and Talalla are there for those looking for a quieter stay.\nWe can\u2019t really talk about travelling in SL and not mention the cultural triangle. Needless to say, these are travel hotspots during the season, making it perfect for tourists and expats. If you\u2019re not too concerned about the historical sites, Kandy and Sigirya also offer plenty of other excursions and activities like the Temple of the Tooth, Udawatte forest, Hantane mountain range and the new Pinnawala Open Zoo.\nIf you're looking for activities off the beaten path, the areas around Sigirya offer some\n!\nTourists love coming to Sri Lanka during December because of the warm of weather. Us locals, on the other hand, wouldn\u2019t mind escaping the heat for a change. Since snow isn\u2019t really a thing here, the hills are where you\u2019ll find the closest thing to Christmas weather.\nmakes for an ideal chilly getaway with it's Colonial atmosphere, incredibly hospitable people and great food. You might experience a few showers but that'll just add to that festive feeling, perfect for a family vacation and hot chocolate!\nNegombo get\u2019s a section of it\u2019s own here, and for good reason. It\u2019s accessible, has plenty of hotels to choose from, a ton of restaurants and bars along with plenty of beach and some\n.\nIt\u2019s also perfect for locals who aren\u2019t getting many days off at the end of the year since it\u2019s literally an hour from Colombo. If you\u2019re a tourist or an expat, Negombo is a great an ideal location to wrap up the last few days of your stay since it\u2019s just a few minutes away from the airport.\nDecember is technically the \u201coff-season\u201d for the Eastern Coast because the tides aren\u2019t great for surfing. The thing about the off-season, however, is that it\u2019s also the time of the year where areas from Arugam Bay up to Passekudah really settle down.\nIt\u2019s definitely not for everyone, but if you\u2019d like to experience a quieter vacation, the East Coast might be an interesting niche pick.\n",
