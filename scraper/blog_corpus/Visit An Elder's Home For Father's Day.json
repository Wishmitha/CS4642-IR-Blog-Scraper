There are many elderly uncles who have no family or friends to visit them or show them that extra bit of love and attention on Fathers Day. So we've put up a list of homes, perhaps in your neighbourhood or around the corner from where you live.\nThese folks will absolutely love some attention and care on Fathers Day. So how about you gather your flock, your parents, your friends,  your children just to pop in at elders home to make a bunch of gents (and ladies) feel included in this celebration? If you can afford it, take them out for a meal, or a tour of Colombo, or have a picnic.\nHere's a list of homes where you would find these elderly folks.This is not a comprehensive list, so do go ahead and add the homes you know in the comment section.\nis home to gents only.
