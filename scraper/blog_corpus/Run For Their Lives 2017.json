  "content": "Back in 2010 Run For Their Lives started off as a relatively small charity run organized by the Roteract Club of Colombo Uptown in aid of the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. Fast forward seven years and RFTL has become probably the biggest charity run in the country with thousands of people taking part.\nWithin the last seven years they\u2019ve also turned RFTL into a social gathering by expanding it into a carnival of sorts, bringing together a bunch of different vendors and sponsors. The best part is that they\u2019ve done it in a way that further benefits the cause, raising over Rs. 19 million over the years, which is no small feat.\nThey\u2019ve managed to do all this without diluting the most important element of the entire event being the run itself. While the funds they\u2019ve raised for the Maharagama Hospital has been incredibly impressive, they\u2019ve also brought in a secondary element of health and wellness to the forefront which really wasn\u2019t happening at this scale prior to RFTL.\nFor this year\u2019s edition of RFTL they\u2019ve partnered up with AIA Vitality to really highlight the health and wellness aspect of the event, which we is think is great. They\u2019re actually bringing in a bunch of cool activities and rewards, which will fit perfectly with the carnival atmosphere.\nThey\u2019ll be having a sort of mini competition during the race called the AIA Vitality Hotstepper where they\u2019ll be giving away a Fitbit to the person who records the most number of steps during the run. You\u2019ll need to have a fitness app or step tracker to take part, but you can just download one on Android or iOS (we recommend\nor\n).\nThey\u2019re also giving away free juice at the end of the race. The catch is that you have to make it yourself by quite literally riding a juice bike that will power the blender, which is pretty damn cool.\nBesides those, they\u2019ll have a little photobooth at the 4 km mark for groups to snap a quick photo during the race and they\u2019ll also have a free BMI checkup at their stall for anyone that wants to find out their body\u2019s actual age, which will likely blow your mind if you\u2019ve never had a BMI checkup before.\nRun For Their Lives is one of the best executed charity events in Sri Lanka and it\u2019s been better every year. The run itself is enough reason to register, but there\u2019s so much more to do afterwards that they\u2019ll have something for everyone. The run begins at the Racecourse Grounds at 6.30 am followed by the carnival which ends at 1 pm.\n",
