  "content": "You'd think you could come across the perfect samosa in some aunty's house or atop a table set for Ifthar. This may be true, but you can also find some stellar samosas at\n.\nPriced at Rs. 50, these beauties are guaranteed to do you the injustice of filling you right up but also leave you wanting more. It isn't fair.\nThey're on the larger side, absolutely stuffed with chunks of potato, bits of carrot and onions. The shell is crispy on the edges which means you get a lovely crunch with every bite. Occasionally they mess it up and you get a sad, soggy samosa but we don't judge.\nMany a time have I greedily purchased more\nand ended up having to donate them with a teary eye and a groaning tummy. Tragic. And delicious.\n",
