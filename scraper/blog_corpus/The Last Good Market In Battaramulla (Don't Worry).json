In a city with few walkable streets and high rents, it has enabled anyone with a talent to reach an audience and grow. Though it started in Diyatha Uyana, that period is over. Now it's a Saturday affair, currently at Racecourse but moving to a new venue soon.\nThe final Good Market runs from 1-9 PM.\nThe Good Market started in December 2012, about 6 months after YAMU started actually. As of June 2015, it will be 2 and a half years old. In that time they've delighted thousands of visitors and enabled vendors of everything from honey to massages to rice and curry to find a market and even expand.\nThe Good Market has also been different because it's not a purely commercial venture, at all. It's really much more of a social enterprise. Vendors have to meet certain\nfor environmental, social and health impact and everyone is vetted and helped along that path. Beyond that, however, stalls are quite cheap and the whole thing is conducted to maximize value rather than profit. And people have responded.\n",
