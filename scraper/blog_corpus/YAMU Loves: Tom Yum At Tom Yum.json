A home-style classic that binds the signature herbs and spices of Thai cuisine together in a fiery broth, it is a vividly sensory experience. Intensely aromatic, deeply spicy and a riot of colours and textures, it is a deceptively simple soup with a surprising depth.\nFrom the Thai words \u2018tom\u2019 which means a boiled broth and \u2018yum\u2019 or sour and spicy, tom yum is often referred to as the \u2018national aroma\u2019 of Thailand. Fresh herbs such as galangal (or Thai ginger), lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves form the foundation, bird\u2019s eye chillies (and chilli paste) bring the heat, and seafood or meat add the heft. Laden with prawns, tom yum goong is the most popular iteration of the dish, while tom yum gai includes chicken.\nFar from a fussy, restaurant-style dish, tom yum is the very definition of Thai home cooking. As Thai food blogger Leela Punyaratabandhu, who writes a popular food blog called\n, says in\npiece on Serious Eats, \u201cIn Thailand, while dishes like Pad Thai...are almost always left to the street food cooks, tom yum is rooted firmly in the home kitchen. This is what a mother makes with a plate of Thai omelet for dinner when the fridge is nearly bare. It's what a father who only cooks once a decade, can make blindfolded.\u201d\nOur search for a tom yum that ticks all the boxes led us to an unassuming restaurant by the same name in Bambalapitiya, which has been dishing out street-style Thai food since 2014. On our first visit, a couple months ago, Tom Yum\u2019s rendition of its namesake dish left us breathless. Each mouthful of the soup, dressed with a slick of chilli oil, hid a knockout punch. Scorching the\nwhile also delivering plenty of chew from the generously strewn squid and prawns, it was a sinus-clearing dish that sent our endorphins into a tizzy.\nA family recipe handed down to Rom, who co-owns the restaurant along with her husband Divanka, Tom Yum\u2019s version of the dish derives its gut-punch heat from tiny, local kochchi chillies. A shoo-in for hard-to-source bird\u2019s eye chillies, they perform their role valiantly. Here\u2019s a hat tip: Don\u2019t ask for the spice to be toned down, it defeats the purpose. Instead, order a full-bodied bowlful, which can easily satiate two to three diners, the next time you visit. And when the fire subsides, leave us a comment to tell us what you thought.\nA portion of tom yum goong and tom yum gai at Tom Yum costs Rs. 750. Read our earlier review of the restaurant\n.\n",
