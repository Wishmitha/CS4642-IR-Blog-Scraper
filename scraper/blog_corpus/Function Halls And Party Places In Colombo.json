In this round up, we're focusing on slightly larger spaces \u2014 the perfect spot whether it's for a group of noisy ten year olds, or even noisier 21 year olds. Wait up though, because these venues could also be used for engagement parties, weddings, anniversaries, batch parties... and well, practically anything else you could think of.\nThis isn't by all means a complete list of places. Let us know of any other places which are your favourites, or which we've missed.\nBest Western Elyon\n\nSo that's our quick list of places to have parties or functions, which we hope is especially useful this holiday season. Tell us what else you recommend.\n",
