In the last couple of months, however, they've really picked their socks back up with alert, efficient staff, and stocked pastry shelves. While we brace ourselves for a re-review, we thought we'd highlight one of the best pastries we've had in Colombo.\nWith the anti-bacon brigade in Colombo starting to chip away at menus around town, a bacon and egg pastry is hard to come by. The DBU pastry however, stays true.\nWith little bits of chopped pork bacon, boiled egg, and light spice gently ensconced in flaky, buttery pastry, this is the perfect one-stop breakfast if you want to treat yourself. Clocking in at a superbly reasonable Rs. 100 a pop, this is a much cheaper option than your average cold, hard, and generally miserable chain-store bakery pastry (we're looking at you, P&S).\nSo head to the DBU (mornings are best, say between 9 AM to 12 noon), grab yourself a handful of flaky, soft, pastry, and sink in. Sink into happiness. Lick that butter off your fingers, and bask in the glow of how good life is.\n",
