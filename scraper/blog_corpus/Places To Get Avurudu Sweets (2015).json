Here's a quick list of places to get traditional Avurudu sweets, though you should probably order as early as possible.\nLakpahana (across from the Racecourse) takes orders for the whole range of Avurudu sweets. \"Kavum, Kokis, Aasmi, Athirasa, Mung Kavum, Kaludodol, Aluwa, Pani Walalu, Narang Kavum and Cadjew Puhul.\" Plus a lot more. They're a reliable bet, especially for slightly larger quantities.\nThe Good Market will also be having Avurudu games and festivities on Saturday the 11th of April at the Racecourse Grounds.

We've had the rasakevili at Mt.Lavinia hotel in the past so we can definitely vouch for it. Other hotels will also most likely be having Avurudu sweets available so keep an eye out.\nOdel will be having a sort of fair from the 8th to the 13th with Avurudu sweets as well as traditional activities.\nMost of the bakeries will be having Avurudu sweets on offer, but not all of them will be very good.
