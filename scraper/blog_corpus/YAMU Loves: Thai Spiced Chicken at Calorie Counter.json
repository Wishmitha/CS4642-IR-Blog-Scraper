The chicken is tender and more than enough for one person so you're actually eating a filling meal for such a small amount of calories.\nThe dish is accompanied by a tangy watermelon and pineapple salsa that packs a punch thanks to a perfect balance of sweet and tangy. You can pick and choose your vegetables (either steamed, grilled or a portion of green salad) and your carbs (mashed sweet potato, baked potatoes, kurakkan bread, Moroccan couscous or Red Rice Vermicelli).\nI usually go with the steamed vegetables which are fresh and wonderfully crunchy along with baked potatoes for carbs. The baked potatoes are soft with crisp skins and are salted and peppered adequately.\nFor Rs. 600 this dish is a steal. Also I'd recommend you try the sweet potato mash if you aren't a fan of baked potatoes.\n",
