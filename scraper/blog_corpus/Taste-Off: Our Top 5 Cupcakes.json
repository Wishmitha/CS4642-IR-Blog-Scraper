We suspect the cupcake movement in Colombo began about three years ago when it was just a few home-bakers, but it's pretty mainstream now and you can get some almost anywhere in the city.\n\n\n\nBut who does it best? We sampled some of the most popular cupcake bakers out there and came up with a list for you guys. The taste-off was just another typical hard day at work - all those pretty cupcakes seated on the table, waiting to be eaten. At the end of the day, we were done with cupcakes for the rest of the year! (Just kidding, we had some the next morning, because shameless gluttony.)\n\nWe judged the cupcakes based on price, size, icing, cake and presentation (although Confucius once said never judge a cupcake by its looks). We focused on chocolate and vanilla cupcakes. Before we get started, do keep in mind that this is pretty subjective (as are all reviews) and regardless of our ranking, all the bakers below are some of the favoured ones in Colombo.\n\n\ncupcakes, unfortunately, did not make the cut. The cake wasn't that tasty, the frosting plenty but dry, and they looked very old-school, like the stuff our aunties made in the 90s. These are pretty affordable though at Rs. 100.\n\n\n's weren't incredible either - the cake was rather dry and the icing on the chocolate cupcakes was generously coupled with sprinkles, but that did little to make it taste better. They're a bit pricey too, at Rs. 130-200.\n",
