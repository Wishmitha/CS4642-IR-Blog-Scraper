This traffic plan - which will apply from 7:30 AM to 8:45 AM - hopes to ease that. A bit.\nGetting into Colombo from Battaramulla will be partly one-way, fleeing up lanes for traffic to flow better.\nLeaving Colombo and heading to Battaramulla will involve a bit more of a detour. You can enter from Borella side via the Cotta Road, which is relatively simple. This isn't marked as one-way on the map, but it is recommended.\nIf you're coming from Colpetty, however, you need to detour toward Independence Square, then go up Gregory's Road and past the cemetary.\nHere's the official police map if you can make head or tail of it:\nWe hope this makes sense. They will be having rehearsals on Saturday from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM and on Sunday from 7:30 AM to 8:45 AM. So if you're living around there, you'll figure out the plan soon enough.\nGood luck, and Godspeed.\n",
