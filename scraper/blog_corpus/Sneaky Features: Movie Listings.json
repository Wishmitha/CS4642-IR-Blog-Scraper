Anyways, Malinthe just added something new -\n.\nWe're not making movies yet (just\n), but you can see a list of most of the movies playing in Colombo right now. As I write this, the big ones are Alien: Covenant and Guardians Of The Galaxy.\nFrom the interface Mal built you can see what's playing, which cinemas it's in, and get a quick link to book tickets. We'll keep adding theatres and options, but try it out and tell us what you think. It's on the bottom of the front page, and at\nas well.\n",
