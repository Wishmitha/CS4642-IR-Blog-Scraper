That\u2019s because that\u2019s where the baby keeps its brain, and the brain is where we keep everything else.\nEverything your child know, feels or does comes from their brain, and 80% of that brain is wired up AFTER they\u2019re born. Brains are built, not born. This is good news for fathers, because we can\u2019t give birth.\nBut how on earth are we supposed to build a brain, especially if we barely understand how it works? The brain is a complex system that scientists barely understand, so what are parents supposed to do?\nLuckily, you don\u2019t have to understand everything. You just need to get out of the way and the brain will do the rest. As parents, if we provide a healthy, loving and stimulating environment for the brain, it will grow. Automatically.\nIn simple terms, if you just feed your kids well, you\u2019re feeding their brain giving it the energy to do what it does. If you protect them from stress, you\u2019re protecting their brain, keeping it from getting damaged. Finally, if you play with them, you\u2019re literally expanding their mind, enabling their brain to make healthy, happy connections. UNICEF calls these three things nutrition, protection and stimulation or EAT, LOVE and PLAY.\nLet\u2019s start with eat.\nYour brain is a physical organ that makes up around 2% of your weight but burns up to 20% of your energy. So you have to feed the thing. The most basic thing a parent can do is make sure that their baby is getting the energy it needs, because that\u2019s what most directly builds their growing brain.\nMothers produce milk, and for the first six months this is the best thing for baby. However, modern mothers also have to go back to work, and breastfeeding is hard, so parents use formula sometimes. Exclusive breastfeeding is, however, recommended as much as possible for the first six months. Even though fathers have nipples, they are unfortunately useless, so the best we can do is offer support.\nWhen we start feeding the baby real food, we need to introduce a balanced diet with a lot of vegetables and fruits. We also need to fight well-meaning relatives to keep salt and especially sugar out. If you go to any Sri Lankan kids birthday party you will find this nearly impossible, but you have to try.\nMother\u2019s milk and a balanced diet gives your child\u2019s brain the nutrients and energy it needs to make connections. But what those connections are is determined by something else.\nThe next thing a parent can do is love.\nAnother way of thinking of love is protection. Your baby can\u2019t move, so you have to protect it, and not just from physical harm. Emotional harm and stress is just as damaging to a child.\nIn the brain, you can think of stress as a chemical called cortisol. We need cortisol, but if levels get too high, it actually becomes physically toxic and damages the brain.\nWhen a parent is violent towards an infant it releases a lot of cortisol and damages not only their body but their brains. The same thing happens if a parent yells at their child, or if the child is in an environment where people are yelling at or hitting each other.\nYou create the only world your baby knows, and if that early world is stressful the child\u2019s brain becomes wired around stress. That means that even as adults they can feel fundamentally threatened and unsafe, and unhappy. It\u2019s not impossible to overcome, but it makes them harder for them to love others and love themselves.\nAt the same time, there is normal stress that a child needs to learn to deal with, and children do cry. Sometimes a lot. Parents often look at these as moments to discipline a child or change their behavior, but it\u2019s actually a chance to change their brain.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a child\u2019s brain is still very much under construction. They\u2019re not manipulating you or being naughty, they\u2019re simply not capable. So when your toddler is refusing to share, throwing a tantrum or \u2018behaving badly\u2019 it helps to remember that they are simply unable to manage their big emotions. A child should never be punished for the immaturity of their brain. You cannot \u2018spoil\u2019 a baby, but if you\u2019re harsh with them you can actually damage their brain.\nSo if your baby is crying, understand that this is the only way for them to communicate their needs. Don\u2019t be afraid to pick them up and soothe them as often as they need.\nIf you physically and emotionally comfort your child when they\u2019re stressed, then their brain releases oxytocin, which calms them down. At first we have to do this for them, basically by hugging them, but in time their brain learns the loop and they\u2019re able to comfort themselves. So cuddle them before you try to teach them anything, because that self-soothing loop is the best thing you can teach their brain.\nThat\u2019s love. They get it from you, and then their brain learns to manufacture it for themselves and for others.\nThe final thing is play.\nSo you\u2019ve fed your child\u2019s brain, loved it and protected it from harm. It still needs to grow. That\u2019s where play comes in.\nWhen you play with your kid they don\u2019t just giggle and feel good in the moment - they learn how to feel good in the future. Their body releases dopamine and natural opioids and they both feel and learn joy. For now that joy is rolling around with you, but as they grow they can transfer that joy to school, to work, and to their own relationships and your grandchildren.\nJust like a comforting hug makes a loop between stress to relief, physical play makes a loop between the world and joy. As adults they can use this loop to enjoy their studies, their job, the arts, and other people. And playing is simply fun for everyone to do. It makes your brain healthier as well.\nSo, this Father\u2019s Day, I hope you\u2019ll remember these three basic things - eat, love, and play.\nScience still can\u2019t tell us how to make a kid sleep, or make them eat vegetables, or cry less - but we do know that what a parent does is much more than those things. As parents, we are literally building brains. The science is solid on that, and it involves fathers as much as mothers.\nWhat we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t teaching our kids lessons, or disciplining them, or training them. What the human species does is use parents to finish wiring our children\u2019s brains, a process that continues into our twenties.\nAs any father knows, at some point you\u2019ll have to deal with teenagers, and getting them to do anything is impossible. However, if you invest in creating a healthy brain early, your kids have a much better chance of making healthy decisions on their own. Because you didn\u2019t drop them on their head. Because you nurtured and developed their brains.\nOne more thing to remember, brain development doesn\u2019t just happen at home. Children that go to a quality preschool from ages 3-5 develop the social and cognitive skills that help them through school and life. This is important for every child, but in Sri Lanka more than half of our children miss out. If you\u2019d like that to change, visit\nand sign a petition to call on the government to ensure access for everyone. While you\u2019re there you can also learn more about early child development and how you can be a better father, mother or caregiver.\nHappy Father\u2019s Day.\n",
