  "review": "Kandos, one of Sri Lanka's oldest chocolate brands, the nostalgia chocolate\nof the '80s, has its own shop on Thurstan Road. They've got everything from the\ncheap silver-wrapper chocolates to chocolate biscuit pudding and kahlua candy.\nEverything is cheap, and it's ideal for some speed gift shopping.\nThe sweets in this shop are generally in the Rs. 20 - 70 range. There's an\ninteresting range, some chocolates shaped like animals, some with kahlua or rum\nin them, even some dessert snacks like tarts and eclairs, all using chocolate\nfriendly ingredients like peanuts, cashews, lemon and marshmallow.\nEverything has that distinct Kandos taste though, a teensy bit bitter and\nnot nearly as creamy as the international brands we've grown to love (nor as\ngood as chocolate you'd find at, say,\n), so if\nyou're an adult your visit here may be purely for nostalgic value. Some of it\nis still quite good though - they have rum infused chocolate biscuit pudding\nwhich the others in office tried, it's very creamy and the rum is strong, and I\npersonally enjoyed the soft marshmallow fudge chocolates and the tiny chocolate\ncookies. Their liquor-infused chocolates come highly recommended among our friends.\nThe eclairs were shape eke tasty, especially for the low price of 70 bucks.\nThe brownie we got was rather bitter though, with a dark hit of coffee in it.\nThere is a whole lot of stuff here, so some of it will be hit and miss, some\nawesome, you'll have to get an assortment and find out.\nThey've got a bunch of ready-made gift boxes as well if you're looking to do\nsome very quick, obligatory gift shopping.\nThe Kandos shop is located on Thurstan Road, opposite the Royal College primary. \nThis used to be the residence of Sri Lanka's own Tony Stark, the legendary Upali \nWijewardene, who disappears under mysterious circumstances while flying in his private jet \nin 1983. He acquired the Kandos company, and brought it into the big time, along with \nother iconic candies such as Delta Toffee.\nThe shop itself is tiny, with glass display\ncases. You tell the guy your choices and he bags it up and you pay the\ncashier. If you're dropping by on a hot day you can get a chocolate drink in a\nlittle cup for Rs. 50, a little watery but Kandosy nevertheless and no kid can\ncomplain.\nThe Kandos Shop is an easy, simple solution if you're looking for cheap and\ntasty over-the-counter chocolatey bites. It's a popular stop and convenient\nespecially if you have kids who are easily excited by chocolate or if you're\njust a die-hard Kandos fan yourself.\n",
