  "review": "It's like a family tradition. No ride to the airport, aachchi's place or a holiday destination up North is complete without a halt at Sasha Food Court.\nApart from the naans, there's nothing fantastic about this place but the handy location, big car park, decent food and efficient service make it a restorative stop on a road trip.\nFresh juices, teas, coffees, rice, sandwiches, pastries, naans, koththus, pizzas, pastas, Chinese food, sweets, Sasha Food Court caters to all needs and budgets.\nLast time we stopped by, we tried their Chicken Biryani (Rs. 520). It was a decent biryani showcasing a lot of different flavours and spices. The basmati rice was well cooked and was soft, and aromatic. The fried chicken leg on the other hand was a bit dry and not that crunchy. Same goes for the deep-fried egg. The piece of roasted pineapple and the mango chutney added an unusual but interesting sweet touch to the dish and the cucumber salad was a good addition to cool down and refresh our palate.\nWe shared another classic, the Lamprais (spelled Lump Rice at the shop) at Rs. 480. The banana leaf held a substantial amount of fiery and fragrant samba rice, a piece of chicken (that I assume was tasty as my partners in crime on that day didn't even let me a bite of it), a deep-fried egg, one tasty cutlet we fought for, brinjal, seeni sambol and some sort of spicy chutney. I'm no lamprais expert so I won't be able to rate the authenticity of the dish but I thought all the elements worked well together.\nWe were pleasantly surprised with the Chicken Noodles (Rs. 620). For some obscure reason, noodle dishes tend to be on the boring side of the food chain. Subtlety spiced with chili and flavoured with tender chicken, fried curry leaves and vegetables, these noodles defied our expectations.\nLast but not least, the Garlic Naans (Rs.120 each), that, given the size of it, they should seriously consider renaming garlic pizzas. Cooked on order, they always come fresh out of the traditional naan oven. Nicely buttery and super garlicky, they're a treat.\nThe other day, we paired it with Butter Chicken (Rs. 200), which is probably not the best option. Nothing bad about it but nothing crazy either. The consistency of the gravy was OK but the taste lacked character. I ended up having my giant garlic naan by itself, which I didn't really mind anyway.\nWe washed everything off with a rich and spicy Masala Tea, priced at Rs. 80 a cup. Deliciously creamy and featuring strong notes of cinnamon and cardamom, you're in for a hearty cuppa.\nAs stated in the restaurant name itself, Sasha is a food court and as such it isn't what I'd describe as a glamourous place but again, as a pit stop, it has everything you could wish for: big car park, clean bathroom and even a playground for kids at the back.\nService is super efficient, you won't wait for long to be served. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and portion sizes.\nSasha Food Court is a convenient eatery when you're in the area and feeling peckish. Stop for a naan, a masala tea or a fresh juice and hit the road again.\n",
