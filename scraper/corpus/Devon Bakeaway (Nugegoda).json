  "description": "The Devon Bakeaway is on your left hand side just before the Nugegoda Fly Over (Past Mc Donald\u2019s). The location is ideal, although finding a parking spot can be extremely difficult in this part of town. They mainly do short eats and cakes but their lunchtime menu of biriyani, fried rice and the essential rice and curry bring in a handful of loyal customers.",
