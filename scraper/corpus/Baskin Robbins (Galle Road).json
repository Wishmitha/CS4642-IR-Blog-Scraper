  "description": "From what we experienced, the Baskin Robbins on Galle Road is run-down and not a good value for money. They managed to disappoint us in pretty much every department, while charging us Rs. 1400 for a three scoop sundae and milkshake.",
  "tip": "Go to Il Gelato. Their ice cream is WAY better and they actually cost less (yeah you know it's bad when Il Gelato costs less).",
