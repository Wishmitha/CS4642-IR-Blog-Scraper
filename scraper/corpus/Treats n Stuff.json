We can now see why they've got such a large following.\nTreats N Stuff is now the only home baker we know of that lets you order brownies and stuff via an app. It's available for\nand\ndevices.\nFor those of you who don't know, Treats n Stuff is a home baker that specializes in a variety of brownies. They've moved away from the general trend of making confectioneries that incorporate products like oreos.  Instead they offer a range of toppings, some of which you'll seldom find elsewhere, like rocky road and praline brownies (which also happen to be our favourites). If you're just looking for some classic brownies, they've got you covered there as well.\nWe recently tried (and loved) the gooey centered brownies at\n. The brownies from Treats n Stuff are more solid in texture, but still yummy. It's really a matter of personal preference as to how you like your brownies. We however, don't mind whichever it is, as long as it tastes good.\nWe got their assorted pack of brownies (Rs. 1400) which had two of each of their different brownies. They currently offer double chocolate, rocky road, praline, chocolate ganache and the classic brownie. You can also grab a pack of any single variety for Rs. 1080. We were also impressed with the overall presentation of the brownies, including the packaging. You basically want to start going at it as soon as you open the box because they look so good.\nLike we mentioned earlier, our favourites were the rocky road and the praline brownies. The rocky road had a melted marshmallow topping with chocolate chips. Maybe I'm just a sucker for marshmallows, but this was so much fun to eat, because the marshmallow topping was gooey and had an almost mozzarella like texture. The praline was probably the sweetest of the bunch, but the flavour of the caramel syrup topping was one of the best we've tasted.\nThe others also tasted good but we felt the chocolate ganache and double choc brownies tasted quite similar (but still good). Besides that, these they've also got strawberry topped brownies which look pretty good on their\n.\nTreats n Stuff adds a creative spin to home baking with their unique range of brownies. As far as Sri Lankan home bakers go, they've got a pretty huge following on Facebook (over 20,000), and we can see why. One thing we'd like to see in the future is a dine-in outlet somewhere in Colombo, with different takes on their already unique brownies.\nWe've seen their brownies pop up on our news feed more than a few times.  So this time we made it a point to give Treats n Stuff a shot.  We can now see why they've got such a large following.\n\nTreats \u2018n\u2019 Stuff \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dad\u0db1\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dca\u0db1\u0dd3 \u0dc3\u0db3\u0dc4\u0dcf \u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
