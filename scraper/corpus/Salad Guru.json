  "description": "Salad Guru is a fun little new enterprise trying its wings at the Good Market. Run by a trained nutritionist, the stall has a whole range of stuff that\u2019s good for you. They range from salads, pastas and soups to quiches and healthy tacos. ",
  "tip": "Since Salad Guru is only operating at the Good Market for now, they sell out pretty quickly. Get there in the early afternoon for variety!",
