  "review": "Awanhala has been around since the 60s, and it is safe to say that while they do not have the fanciest food, they have kept their standards and earned their name as the most common resthouse people who travel on Kandy Road choose to refresh themselves. As soon as you pass Perera & Sons, it is right at the bend on Ambepussa on Kandy Road, to your right.\nThey have buffets, short-eats, and local sweets. It is not a lot, but with a warm cup of tea, they pair quite nicely.\nTheir breakfast buffet is Rs. 590, lunch and dinner at Rs. 650 per person. We weren't looking for a heavy meal so we settled for some short-eats. I have tried the food here and it's pretty good. Certainly not the best rice and curry, but it fills you up.\nWe wanted something sweet so we went for a Thala Bole (Rs. 50) which is a great snack to have with your tea. It was really good with that strong treacle and coconutty taste. The sesame seeds elevated the flavors and gave it a nice crunch. We highly recommend it, it was delicious.\nThe Helape (Rs. 50) was not the best I have had, because it tasted a little dry, but was decent. There was a strong taste of ragi (kurakkan) flour along with a sweet coconutty taste. It would have tasted better had it been freshly made.\nThey have tea, coffee, fresh juices and soft drinks on their menu but if you're ever in Awanhala, the best option is to go for a tea, because they do a mean cup of tea.\nA cup of Milk Tea is Rs. 80 here and it is served with a pot of sugar. The strong tea aroma was instant. It was delicious with a thick texture and succulent flavors. They special order their tea from Mabroc which explains the richness of the tea. A nice, warm cup of this is just what you need to refresh yourself.\nTheir service is efficient, friendly and courteous. The place isn't always crowded, but it is busy. Therefore, the fact that our food was served on time was much appreciated.\nThe place huge with more than enough tables and chairs to host large parties. It's very clean, spacious and simple. They have a small liquor store at the far end of the restaurant. The bathrooms are clean and well maintained.\nI have been here quite a few times, and I can safely say they have managed to keep their standards quite well. It's a familiar place to stretch your legs and enjoy a cup of tea after a long drive.\n",
