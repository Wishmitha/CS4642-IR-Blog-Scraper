  "review": "Yumi Cake's been around for a while, but they moved to a new location down Flower Road. It's a compact and cosy little space, with a pink and white theme cutting across, and lots of homemade goodies including ice creams, pastries, sandwiches and cakes.\nThe staff behind the counter are incredibly attentive and helpful, volunteering information about the produce used and how they make it. We were told that the ice creams were eggless, so yay for vegans. They've got a small selection of interesting flavours including passion fruit and blueberry cheesecake, both of which we tried out.\nDespite being priced at Rs 300 and Rs 350 respectively (a bit too much for a single scoop of ice cream if you think about it), the ice creams didn't disappoint in terms of flavour.\nA bit less on the creamy side and leaning towards a sorbet where the passion fruit was concerned; but the flavour was amazingly authentic and tangy. It just pops in your mouth, so mind that if you can't bear the sourness of the fruit, this is going to be too much for you to handle (sorry Shifani!). While I loved it (despite finding it too intense to enjoy as an ice-cream), Shifani preferred the Blueberry Cheesecake flavour. This legit had bits of frozen cake in it. Pretty cool. Much milder and smoother than its counterpart, we enjoyed this as well.\nWe weren't huge fans of the Nutella Cheesecake Piece (Rs. 540), which was a huge chunk of cheesecake made with the chocolatey hazelnut condiment. Unable to finish it (because we were stuffed), we brought it back to office where the rest of the team agreed that it wasn't anything to write home about either. The cream cheese was blended with Nutella itself, and it did have a nice, creamy consistency, but we think we'd have liked it better if it was a traditional cream cheese base, with a layer of Nutella flavoured cream or Nutella atop.\nTheir Chocolate Brownie Cream Pie Chaos (Rs. 360) was interesting. With bits of brownies crumbled throughout a container of cream, there was also some ganache and a noticable amount of some booze involved, which as Bhagya pointed out, made the cream taste a bit off.\nI really liked their Toasted Chicken Sandwich (Rs. 400) though, which was beautifully made. They make their own bread, which was a wholegrain of sorts, and it's got plenty of greens, generous amounts of chicken, and even generous amounts of thinly sliced almonds and whole raisins thrown in. Personally we could've done without the sweetness of the raisin, but that's because none of us are fans of the little fruit.\nSmall, concise, with just one high table. It's more of a take-away spot than a sit-in-and-eat place, but I think they said that you can sit at\nif you come with a large group \u2014 they share the same premises.\nEverything's spotless and airy, but it's too small to sit around or have a long conversation with a friend. We recommend picking stuff up and going, unless you're super hungry.\nYumi isn't as great as it once was, and we were kinda disappointed at how it's a lot different from what they used to be where flavour and taste was concerned. It's also a bit on the pricey side, but if you want some really good passionfruit ice cream, head over there :)\nDelicious but pricey ice creams, and some good desserts\nYumi Cake is a perfect choice for home-made fudgey brownies and cakes - but surprisingly, they also have a decent healthy menu.\nYumi Cake is a cute little restaurant that serves awesome desserts - chocolate fudge lovers, this is your haven.\n\n\u0d9a\u0da7\u0da7 \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dda\u0d9a\u0dca \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dcf, \u0d9a\u0ddd\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0d8b\u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db6\u0ddc\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0dda \u0dba\u0db8\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dda\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a.\n",
