  "review": "Manhattan Fish Market is pretty much Colombo\u2019s only seafood franchise to date. They started off a bit iffy with their pricing, but they\u2019ve matured well over the past year to become one of the city\u2019s more frequented eateries.\nMost fast food franchises tend to stick to meat with just a few seafood options, but Manhattan Fish Market flipped that on its head when it landed in Colombo a couple of years ago. Their initial pricing was a bit too high, but they addressed the issue by actually lowering their overall price point and introducing deals which offer great value. Keeping all of that in mind, you can have a full meal at MFM for anywhere between Rs. 1000 and Rs. 2500 on the higher end. One peculiar fact is that the franchise doesn\u2019t originate from Manhattan, in fact that they don\u2019t even have a branch in the USA. The name instead is a hat tip to Fulton's erstwhile fish market under the Brooklyn bridge.\nOur visit to MFM was on one of those hellishly hot days, so the first thing we did was to grab two of their mocktails (Rs. 390 each). We honestly weren\u2019t expecting much here other than a cold beverage but the Cala-Cala (calamansi) and Melon Breeze were both refreshing and just right on a warm day. However, the melon was overly sweet and was just a syrupy concoction we didn't finish.\nThey offer everything from mussels, to shellfish, to a range of different fish so there certainly isn\u2019t a lack of choice here. We started off with the ever popular Fish \u2019n Chips (Rs. 900). Dory is the base fish here, but you can choose between barramundi, cherry snapper, cod and salmon which go up to around Rs. 1690.\nHonestly though, the dory works perfectly here. We got two sizeable fillets of dory with a thick, crunchy and well seasoned golden batter resting on a bed of chunky chilli cheese fries and a side of salad with a garlic herb sauce. I generally don\u2019t care much for the salads but this one was actually fresh, and the cheese on the fries wasn\u2019t the cheap supermarket stuff. The main event here is still the fish which is crispy on the outside with a soft (almost creamy) center.\nOur other main was the newly introduced Quad Delight (Rs. 1390) which came with crispy calamari rings, saut\u00e9ed shrimp, batter fried mushrooms and coleslaw along with with a tartar and tomato sauce. The funny part was that we had a tough time identifying the mushrooms because it actually tasted like seafood.\nWe would have liked it if they had thrown in a bit more calamari, but we had no issues with the flavour. In contrast to the mushrooms, batter on the calamari was thin, which we preferred since calamari generally entails some chewing anyway.\nIt was a bit of a toss up for dessert between the sizzling banana fritters and tiramisu (Rs. 440), but we ended up going with the latter. This unfortunately missed the mark with just too much dense cream and too little coffee flavour coming through after the initial topping.\nThe service at the Manhattan Fish Market is relatively fast with our orders coming to the table in under twenty minutes. The staff is attentive and friendly when they speak to at the table, but their greetings when guests enter and exit seem to be a bit forced.\nThe layout at MFM is fairly simple with mostly metal chairs and wooden tables, along with a few couches which seem to be for reservations. It\u2019s not really that impressive and cushions on the seats would be a welcome addition, but they get the job done without overly crowding the space.\nWe were bit skeptical when Manhattan Fish Market first arrived in Colombo, but since then they\u2019ve done a great job of adapting by changing both their menu and the pricing. As far as seafood goes, they offer varied selection at range of prices with solid execution.\nManhattan Fish Market is pretty much Colombo\u2019s only seafood franchise to date. They started off a bit iffy with their pricing, but they\u2019ve matured well over the past year to become one of the city\u2019s more frequented eateries.\nThe Manhattan Fish Market has delicious seafood and ridiculously friendly stuff - it's an awesome place to dine at if you can handle the bill.\nThe Manhattan Fish Market is an excellent Malaysian franchise brought to Sri Lanka with no expense spared. They do consistently high quality seafood with a fair but high price.\nThe Manhattan Fish Market is an excellent Malaysian franchise brought to Sri Lanka with no expense spared.
