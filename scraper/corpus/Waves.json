  "description": "Waves is so good I\u2019d rather it be a secluded seafood jewel tucked at the bottom of Fairline road. The portion are generous and the fares are reasonable.",
  "tip": "I\u2019d avoid lunchtime though-\nAnd spilling chicken on the floor-\nEvermore.\n",
  "review": "Is Waves the Shangri-La of Seafood and Chinese food places in Sri Lanka? Not quite, but it\u2019s a strong contender nevertheless. My quest to seek this hidden jewel was, if at all, the only annoying part, save the crows. With a fleet of mostly great dishes, pretty friendly staff, and a great location Waves sweeps away most of its competition in a single swift torrent.\nWaves is tucked near the Dehiwela end of the Mount Lavinia-Dehiwela beach (roughly at the bottom of Fairline Road, which is quite the journey). It\u2019s excellent; you get the open-air beach experience in an environment that is quiet, and cleaner than the overly active Mount-Lavinian side of the beach. It\u2019s just passed the train tracks and towards your right. Because of the distance from the main road I would recommend going with a guest because the road and area nearby gets very empty.\nMy first reaction when I trekked it near the train tracks was \u2013 \u201cplease don\u2019t let this be waves.\u201d The entrance gives no indication that the white, wooden entrance is in fact, Waves. The building looks a little run down, and being a place for (I assume) primarily dinner it was empty when I arrived.\nThe staff were friendly, although lacking the sort of professionalism you\u2019d see at Loon Tao. They did take about half an hour for my dish, which I guess is understandable given that I saw the guy who took my order in the kitchen cooking it. (?)  They might need more afternoon staff, I can\u2019t really blame the cook.\nOnce upon a review dreary\nhead to four-star stardom\n",
