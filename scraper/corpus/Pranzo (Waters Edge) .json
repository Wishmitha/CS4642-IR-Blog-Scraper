  "review": "Pranzo is an Italian restaurant at Waters Edge that has both indoor and outdoor seating, with pizzas, pastas, lasagna and even grilled meats on offer, and an amazing view. We dropped in for lunch on a sunny day and opted for the view over the A/C.\nThe staff at Pranzo are attentive and courteous. They'll pull out chairs for you and even insist that you keep your bag on a chair. If you make a mess while eating, they'll promptly clean up the table before serving the next course. I felt quite uncouth, what with breadcrumbs around my plate, but they were really smooth about it, and we liked that.\nThe outdoor setting, though, is what you really ought to go here for. The abundance of green shades that surround you really gets you into a good mood. While they do have an air-conditioned dining area indoors with exposed brick walls, it can't quite compare. You could even sit out on the lawn, if the weather allows for it, and the view of the waters and the greens should keep you quite happy till the food arrives.\nWe liked that once you order, they'll serve up a loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar while you wait. Pranzo is meant to be an Italian restaurant, they do have a Sritalian section of their menu with Sri Lankanized options for the discerning palette.\nWe veered away from those options and instead decided to treat ourselves to the Norwegian Salmon under the grilled items. We were quite surprised when the dish arrived with lettuce and pol sambol. The salmon itself was superb.\nGrilled just lightly, the flesh was still juicy and pink on the inside, falling away as we cut through it. The pol sambol did help bring in that saltiness that us lankans crave for, and didn't take away from the salmon.\nAt Rs. 1950, it's a pricey dish, but the quality of the fish seems worth it, especially since they haven't cooked the living colour out of it.\nThe pizza we ordered, Prosciutto e Rucola (Rs. 1,100) was pretty good. We've tried the same at Rocco's recently, and were served a thicker, chewy parma ham, but this one at Pranzo was easier to bite into.\nThe prosciutto at Pranzo is sliced extremely thin, with a glassy feel to it, and isn't overpowering. It lends a saltiness to the pizza, as a cured meat should, but doesn't taste too fatty. The rocket leaves were fresh, and the pizza was served after it had rested well, so no tongues were burnt. Oh, and we even tried some slivers of the salmon along with the pizza, and it really worked!\nPranzo does their own gelato, with just three flavours: vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. We tried the pistachio and it was an instant hit. Beautifully presented, with some thick honey, glazed pistachio nuts and raspberry compote, there was just enough going on to make each spoonful delicious. The gelato is thick and creamy, doesn't taste too milky, and isn't overly sweet, with a distinct pistachio flavour coming through. Highly recommended! At Rs. 300 per scoop, it's fully worth it.\nPranzo might not be the best thing at Waters Edge, but it's definitely got one of the best views. We'd go just for that. The food can be quite pricey, costing around Rs. 2000 per head, but if you'd like to indulge yourself, it's worth it.\n, we learnt that the prawn ravioli is a stellar dish, so do try that, too!\nThe food can be quite pricey, but if you'd like to indulge yourself, it's worth it.\nPranzo is the Italian restaurant that just opened at Waters Edge. Colombo could use some good Italian since most of our 'Italian' restaurants specialize in mostly pizza. The food at Pranzo is actually pretty good, there's a view, and you'll be glad to know it isn't over-the-top expensive.\n",
