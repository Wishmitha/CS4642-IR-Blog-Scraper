  "review": "Priced at below 400 rupees and wrapped in banana leaves, Lunu Ambulla's lunch packets are tasty and affordable.\nWe tried five different types of\npackets - Roast Chicken Rice and Curry (Rs 350), Fish Rice and Curry (Rs 220), Cuttlefish Rice and Curry (Rs 350), Chicken Biriyani (Rs 250) and Chicken Fried Rice (Rs 280).\nTheir curries are mass produced, so most packets have the same curries. The Rice and Curry (Cuttlefish, Fish and Roast Chicken) had\nmango curry, lots of\nand\nAdequately spicy, Lunu Ambulla knows their way through Sri Lankan curries. The tangy mango curry, spicy\nand mildly spicy\nmade a great combination.\nThe Roast Chicken Rice and Curry was totally worth buying. For 350 rupees, it comes with a fried chicken leg (thigh+drumstick) and the other Rice and Curry essentials.\nA massive turn away from your conventional Chicken Fried Rice and packed with a solid\n\npeppery brinjal curry, well cooked\nand spicy chicken curry, Lunu Ambulla's Chicken Fried Rice surpasses standard expectations.\nThis unauthentic, Sri Lankanized biriyani didn't impress. The piece of chicken was small and bony, and the rice just wasn't flavourful. On a scale of one to five, this ranked at two.\nIt's a little\nwith low stools and table - not the ideal spot if you want to feel like royalty as you drool over the\n. It's more of a buy-and-leave spot, but they have seating for about 10 people.\nThere is one man attending to your rice needs, and based on our experience, he's quick and well trained.\nPacked with an elephantine amount of rice in true Lankan style, the food's good, except for their biriyani. It has been around Thimbirigasyaya for years and they have made a name for themselves among affordable\npacket lovers. So, if you're around and in need of lunch, Lunu Ambulla is a reliable option.\nGood rice packets for affordable prices.\nAmbulla, on Thimbirigasyaya Road, is a new-ish bath kade with a rustic feel that does lunch packets. Some are decent; others are outstanding.\n\n\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db9\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dba \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc0\u0db1\u0d82 \u0da2\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad \u0db4\u0dcf\u0dbb \u0db4\u0da7\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0d87\u0db9\u0dd4\u0dbd \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dd9\u0dc4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dda \u0db6\u0dad\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca\n",
