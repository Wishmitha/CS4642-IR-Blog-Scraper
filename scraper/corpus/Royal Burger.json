  "review": "Royal Burger is yet another place in Colombo to sink your teeth into a juicy burger without busting your wallet. It's a less glamorous, not-quite-there-yet version of the reigning royalty that is\n, and for just Rs. 200-300 you can get one of their cheese dripping, cholesterol happy burgers, with a great glass of iced milo on the side.\nIt's not just burgers on the menu - they also do submarines, rice, pastas and lasagnas. You can\n. Everything here is kind of oily, in a very satisfying junk food kind of way.\nOur\ncost Rs. 320 and it was pretty delicious - soft bread, a simple combo of cheese, mayo and tomato, and the punch is in the patty. The meat is crumbly and toothsome, a little spicy even, and among the more satisfying street-food burgers in town.\nWe also got the classic\n- the burger alone costs only Rs. 220 while for 120 bucks more you can get fries and a soda with it. The fries are oily and not much unless you're just looking for something to snack on when you've got the munchies, and this burger again was pretty tasty though not as good as the double beef. It's got plenty of lettuce, sauce and mayo wrapped over a hefty piece of crunchy, juicy batter fried chicken - it's an oily meal though, your fingers will show it once you're done with the burger, so though very satisfying you're going to feel really heavy afterwards.\nThese guys also unexpectedly do a bunch of spaghettis and pastas. We got the\n, which is basically a giant plate of spaghetti bathed in a bucket of mild, white cheese sauce, with chunks of chicken bacon and chicken floating in it. It's something a college student would make in a hurry, and if you're a hungry RI student from the neighborhood taking a lunch break it probably does the job.\nAlso note, these guys do an amazing\n- just the right amount of sweetness, very refreshing, better than most I've tried at kottu joints.\nRoyal Burger is a small, clean shop on a busy corner of Havelock Road.\nRoyal Burger is a very reliable stop on Havelock Road for cheese dripping, affordable burgers and subs. It's a popular lunch option among the RI students in the neighborhood.\n\n\u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0da9\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0dc5\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dd9 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dcf\u0da9\u0dd2 15\u0d9a 20\u0d9a \u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0db1\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0. \u0d87\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d89\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0dbb \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0db9\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda \u0dc4\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0db6\u0dd1\u0db1\u0dd9. \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0ddd\u0dc3 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dbd \u0d9c\u0dd9\u0daf\u0dbb \u0dba\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf. \u0d92\u0dad\u0dca \u0d85\u0dbb \u0d9c\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0da9\u0dca \u0da0\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca...\n",
