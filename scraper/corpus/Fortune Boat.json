  "description": "Fortune Boat was a wonderful find. It's a Chinese restaurant, hidden just off Independence Square near the newly refurbished Colombo Racecourse. You'd never spot it unless you happened to be walking round there.\n",
  "tip": "As is the case with most places, the bill comes to rather a lot if you order drinks. We accidentally ordered a rather potent cocktail which cost Rs. 1000. So maybe just stick with table water.\n\nHappy Hour is 6.30 to 7.30",
