  "description": "We've had quite a few new ice cream parlors pop up over the past few years (no complaints from us!), but Il Gelato still reigns supreme when it comes to high quality ice cream. There's just this small issue of having to empty your wallet for a few scoops..",
  "tip": "If you're planning on going for 2 scoops, go for the cup over the gelato kinder (glass bowl). They use a traditional scooper for the latter, so the scoops are smaller.",

There's just this small issue of having to empty your wallet for a few scoops..\nThis place serves very good ice-cream and, unusually for SL, has maintained high standards for over a decade.  The cream-based chocolate and nut flavours are particularly excellent (I recommend Dark chocolate, Hazelnut and Pistachio) while the lighter more sorbet-consistency fruit flavours(go for passion fruit and fruits of the forest) are sharp and refreshing.\nWe've had quite a few new ice cream parlors pop up over the past few years (no complaints from us!), but Il Gelato still reigns supreme when it comes to high quality ice cream.
