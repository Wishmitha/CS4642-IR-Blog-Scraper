  "review": "More commonly known as Vani Vilas, Shri Vani Vilas has been around for a couple of generations and has a reputation for being one of the best\u2014if not\n\u2014saivars around. They have a huge range of food on offer, from your regular\nand\n, to more elaborate dishes such as the tandoori platter, mushroom pepper fry, and Lucknowi dum biryani. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and make you feel right at home.\nThere is an upstairs and downstairs section. The downstairs is your regular, fast-paced\nwhich is perfect for the working crowd in a hurry, while the upstairs is more like a proper restaurant for families and kids. We dined upstairs, in the airconditioned restaurant.\nTheir staff are warm\u2014like people you've known for ages\u2014while also being professional. They are caring and concerned about whether you enjoyed the food, and also urge you to tuck into some of the dishes while they are still hot. (They were also keen on helping me with photographing the food).\nNow, to get down to the food. We began our meal with regular fare like the\nand ghee roast.\nThis vadai (Rs. 60)  is hands down one of the best I've tried. There are few places that get this fluffy doughball right. Vani Villas hits the spot by frying the\nto crisp, golden perfection. Piping hot, the\nwas soft and moist on the insides and wonderful to bite into.\nThe ghee roast (Rs. 240) was beautifully presented, but slighty doughy on the inside and not up to the standard of the crispy thin ghee roast at\n.\nThe hot and sour soup looked intensely spicy, but it was lacking in heat. It also had an off-putting consistency, having been thickened with corn flour. It wasn't bad overall, and fragnant from the leeks and bits of herbs that had been added to it, but it didn't live up to its name either.\nTheir honey chilli potatoes were a bit of a surprise because we were expecting potatoes and got fries instead. But the caramelised and lightly syrupy fries sprinkled with chilli powder and chopped spring onion greens, made the dish very interesting.\nGarnished with a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds, this was a taste that grew on you with every bite.\nThe Lucknow Dum Biryani was surprisingly good as well, with fragrant grains of basmati rice and fried onions on top. It almost melted in your mouth, and was packed with subtle flavour.\nThis was good, but everything paled in comparision to the Tandoori Platter, which at a mere Rs. 650 was the most expensive dish of the day. Presented on a sizzling and spluttering platter, it came as a very pleasant surprise.\nIt was generously laden with paneer (both tandoori and non-tandoori grilled paneer), and a plethora of fruits and greens (tangy pineapple, bell peppers, broccoli and lettuce).\nAll of them were grilled just right \u2014 charred perfectly on the outside, and moist and soft inside. I'm no paneer expert, but that tandoori paneer was the best I've ever had. The stewards were kind enough to show me how to cut it up as well, although I'm sure I would have succeeded if I had tried it myself  :D\nI was almost about to give Vani Vilas a five-star rating, had it not been for the soup and the overly sweet drinks we tried. This little restaurant whips up some amazing food in its unlikely location on busy and heavily industrialized Armour Street. It's a little jewel in that area, and well-worth visiting.\n",
