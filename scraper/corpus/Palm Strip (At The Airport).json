  "description": "This has long been among the most exciting restaurants in the city. Not because of its cutting edge cuisine but because, for years, this was the only place to eat at Katunayake (BIA) airport. So a meal at the Palm Strip meant you were going places. ",
  "tip": "Dont come here expecting a great or even a good meal.\nThe food, at best, it tolerable. (I find the club sandwich good value)\nThe point is really a breather between boarding and checkin. \nA moment to sit, eat and reflect on the journey ahead.",
