  "review": "Gami Gedara (\u0d9c\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd9\u0daf\u0dbb) offers a buffet-style dining experience. From Mixed Rice to Biriyani to Rice and Curry, their food is as fresh as it is good.\nWhat makes this place special is it's rather mod interior and their smart use of compartment-trays on which your food is served. It's the little things that make something stand out.\nThe Rice and Curry (Rs. 160 for the veg option) is served buffet-style. You get to pick and choose what curries you want, what rice you'd prefer etc. Our curries of choice consisted of\n\n,\n, beetroot, dhal, onion salad and of course;\n. Each curry was fresh and seasoned adequately.\nThe red rice had a rich, nutty flavour coming through which complimented the add-ons.\nIt's healthy, so that's an added bonus.\nThe Mixed Rice (Rs. 350) was basically bits of sausage, chicken and vegetables incorporated into fried rice. By default you are served portions of chop suey, coleslaw, gravy and chilli paste but you can switch them up as you wish and also pick your meat of choice.\nVishvi opted for a hefty helping of pork and her verdict was positive. She says the pork was soft, spicy and there was actual meat as opposed to the usual chunks of fat.\n\nThe Biriyani (Rs. 350) isn't traditional biriyani, but it's still very good. The rice tasted like chicken stock, came with chopped cilantro and plenty of caramelised onions scattered about. The chicken was a little tough on the outside but soft on the inside.\nIt didn't shine and was rather bland but we're not complaining.\nThe egg was just added on for decorative purposes as it was extremely rubbery, so we didn't bother with that.\nService is pretty much DIY. You order over the counter, help yourself to drinks from the fridge and pay at said counter once you're done eating. Mysteriously enough there are a LOT of people hanging out behind the counter so they aren't under-staffed.\nThe place is cute, with wooden tables and chairs painted bright colours like blue and green. The counter is presented in true local style with clay pots and banana leaves used as utensils.\nIt was unbearaby hot and stuffy inside, but they fixed that by turning the AC on. The AC was leaky but they fixed that by not acknowledging it.\nIf you're ever in Nugegoda around lunch time, head to Gami Gedara. Their food is top-notch and you'll get your money's worth.\nGami Gedara is a little eatery in Nugegoda. They serve up some good rice and curry, so we spent our lunch-break here.\n\n\u0db1\u0dd4\u0d9c\u0dda\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9 \u0dc4\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a \u0db6\u0dad\u0dca \u0db6\u0da9\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d86\u0dc0\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca, \u0d94\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db8\u0dc4\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dba\u0ddd \u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
