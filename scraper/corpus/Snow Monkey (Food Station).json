  "review": "Snow Monkey has moved from their outlet in Kollupitiya to the Food Station on Vinyalankara Mawatha. They have been operating there since last year and it has become a crowd favorite.\nThey have exactly 10 flavors from which you can choose from, such as Bluemist, Blackcurrant, Nelli, Spearmint etc. You can try more than one flavor so it depends on your preference.\nWe tried 3 separate flavors. The small cup is at Rs. 100 and the large one is Rs. 200.\nThe ice melts pretty fast but they do give you straws so you can eat and drink at the same time.\nTheir service was efficient albeit not the most pleasant, which I understand, the heat does not help.\nThe ambience is the same as it had always been at the food station; simple and spacious. The street noise might be a downside as well as the fact that it is not air-conditioned. It didn't bother us considering what we were having, but I could see how uncomfortable it could be if you want to enjoy some kottu from\n.\nWe really like Snow Monkey. Quite frankly, Colombo needs to expand on this concept because we all know how hot it can get here. If you ever wanna cool off, there's really no better way than ingesting ice, so check them out.\nIf you ever wanna cool off, there's really no better way than ingesting flavored ice.\nSnow Monkey is perfect for a hot day in Colombo (which is everyday)\n\n\u0d94\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dca\u0db1\u0ddd \u0d9a\u0ddd\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc3\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd8\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dad\u0dca \u0dbd\u0d82\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dbd\u0dd4.\n",
