  "description": "A simple home cook that serves shelled crab - a real pleasure to eat. ",
  "tip": "One day notice required. You need to speak Sinhala to order.",
  "review": "Dilan's is a home cook that does crab without the shell. That's right. You can enjoy tasty crab meat without having to fight thru its protective exoskeleton. The product isn't cheap (Rs. 5,000 for a big tub, enough for four greedy people) but we think it's good value for money.\n",
