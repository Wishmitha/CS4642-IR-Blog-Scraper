  "description": "<em>Pasco Food Blush is a new eatery that has recently come up on Pannipitiya road in Battaramulla. It\u2019s only a few meters away from where Coco Citrine used to be (they\u2019ve been replaced by La Trattoria \u2013 a fancy new Italian restaurant). If you\u2019re driving past Food Blush in the night, it\u2019s pretty hard to miss - there\u2019s a bright neon sign and a big screen out in the courtyard facing the road.\r\n</em>",
