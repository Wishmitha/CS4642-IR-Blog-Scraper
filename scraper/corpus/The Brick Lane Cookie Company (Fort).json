  "review": "The Brick Lane Cookie Company opened up their newest stall in Fort a couple of weeks ago. We tried a bunch of their cookies along with their interesting new additions, and they were all pretty great.\nIt feels like Brick Lane has been around for a long time, even though they started out in March. We first visited their Crescat Boulevard stall a few days after they first opened up. Since then they've stepped up their game, introduced new flavours and even delivery.\nThey now offer around 11 different flavours with the basic range priced at Rs. 120 and the luxury range with ingredients like Oreos and Nutella priced at Rs. 160, but should they've got some good offers for orders of over 3 cookies. Besides that, they offer cookies with ice cream, berry smoothies and another very interesting addition, but more on that one later.\nThe newest addition to their list of cookies is the red velvet (Rs. 160), and it's unlike other cookies we've tasted. The name couldn't be more appropriate since it's a cookie rendition of a red velvet cake in terms of both flavour and texture. The cookie itself is very soft and has a smooth texture, which works nicely with the milkiness of the white chocolate chips. We'd say it's a successful invention.\nThe triple chocolate chip (Rs. 160) is, as one would expect, extremely chocolatey. It's a dark chocolate cookie, with milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and of course, Nutella. Personally, it's a bit too much chocolate for me, but I can see chocoholics going nuts about this one. I would probably had liked it more if it was a bit gooey but that's mostly a personal preference.\nAnother new addition is the Oreo cookie (Rs. 160), or as we call it, cookieception. This was a pretty smart move on their part. People love Oreos as it is, so mix it in with some cookie dough, and you've got a solid combination. They haven't really skimped on the Oreos either, with ours being nearly equal parts cookie and Oreo.\nOddly enough though, my personal favourites were the double choc chip and the classic chocolate chip (Rs. 120). There weren't any crazy twists in these, but just the a well baked butter cookie and a good ratio of chocolate chips. Also these hit a nice sweet spot in terms of texture.\nTheir most interesting new addition though, has to be the tempura fried chocolate bars. We tried the fried Mars bar and Snickers bar and they were both just as good as we'd hoped. With the crispy tempura batter adding a great contrast to the sweet melted chocolate and caramel. It's Rs. 400 for three bars which is also not too bad.\n\nTheir berry smoothies are also quite nice. We tried the blueberry smoothie (Rs. 350). These are low in sugar but adequately sweet. Just let them know the preferred consistency, since some like it thicker than others.\nThe new stall is located right opposite the World Trade Center, at the entrance of the Colombo City Hotel. It's a very accessible location and they've even got some seating which is shared with the hotel.\nThey bake pretty much right throughout the day so the cookies are fresh and warm, more often than not. With the opening of the new stall they also began delivery, which is awesome. Really nice people as well, so it's a very pleasant experience.\nThe cookie culture in Sri Lanka hasn't quite picked up like brownies and cupcakes. But for those who do love cookies, The Brick Lane Cookie Company is the place for you.\n",
