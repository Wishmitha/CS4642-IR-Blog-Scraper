  "description": "Over the weekend I found myself wandering about Majestic City doing a bit of shopping. After a couple of tiresome hours of trying to find a gift, I hungrily dragged myself to the spacious, although somewhat crowded, Majestic City food court. They offer a good variety of food to choose from; there\u2019s a Pizza Hut, KFC, Magic Corn, Juice by Roots, Chinese and Mongolian food stalls, and there\u2019s even a small pastry shop in the corner. Personally though, the main feature would have to be Peppers \u2013 Pizza and Pasta.\r\n",
