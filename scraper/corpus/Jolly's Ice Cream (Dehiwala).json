  "review": "Jolly's Ice Cream serves up some really nice ice cream with a super authentic Sri Lankan touch. Originated in Nittambuwa, they\u2019ve opened their second branch in Colombo in the suburbs of Dehiwala, near Arpico Super Center.\nPriced at Rs. 180 a scoop, Jolly\u2019s Ice Cream offers a wide range of flavours. You can either get them on a waffle cone or in a plastic cup. We tried five flavours: Swiss Chocolate, Blueberry, Kiri Kopi, Bubblegum and Cinnamon.\nWe also tried the Raspberry flavour (Rs. 200), a limited edition ice cream that Jolly\u2019s has introduced specially for this Christmas season. It took us by surprise because we never expected it to have such a legit flavour. The bits of raspberry embedded in the pink coloured creamy, milky texture were a nice touch. While enhancing the flavour, it added a bit of tartness and gave a fruity kick.\nAccording to the manager, they infuse the ice cream with natural raspberries. This deliciousness hasn\u2019t taken permanent residence on the Jolly\u2019s menu yet, but they hope it will if the demand increases.\nThe guy manning the counter was super fast and very friendly. He'd let you try the different flavours before you place the order, which is very thoughtful. As for the environment, there\u2019s a seating area at the entrance of the Arpico Super Center. Plus, there\u2019s the takeaway option too.\nSame as our last visit to the\n, we had a really nice experience here at Dehiwala Jolly\u2019s outlet. We highly recommend their ice cream, especially because of their unique set of Ceylon influenced flavours they offer at a fair price tag.\nJolly's Ice Cream serves up some really nice ice cream with a super authentic Sri Lankan touch.\n\n\u0d9a\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7\u0dbb\u0dda \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0da9\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dd0\u0da9. \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d85\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dca \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a \u0dbd\u0dd1\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0daf\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf.\n",
