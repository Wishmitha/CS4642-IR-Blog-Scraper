  "review": "Candle Light Hut is an affordable family restaurant that serves up some great plates of Pakistani meats and biriyani. If you're out with a group and want to stuff yourself with South Asian spicy cuisine without ruining your wallet, this is not a bad choice.\nThis is a pretty good place to consider if you're into Indian or Pakistani food (though they technically also have Italian and Western on the menu). The portions are big, so the prices are easy, and the curries are spicily prepared and delicious.\n",
