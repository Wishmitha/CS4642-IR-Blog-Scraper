  "review": "Pedlar's Gelato has always been a popular watering hole for those parched and seeking the blessed, cold touch of ice cream.\nThey're still in the same place they've been in all these years and apart from a few furniture additions, nothing much has changed. Except for the quality of their ice creams.\nAfter years of having heard of this place and recommendations galore, we settled on the Pistachio, White Chocolate, Mango and Double Chocolate ice creams, each costing us Rs. 250.\nThe guy over the counter is pretty efficient and really considerate. Despite our feeble requests for cups instead of cones, we were handed two waffle cones which we then sheepishly asked to be put into cups for convenience (we were laden with heavy bags and a bus to catch back home). He didn't bat an eye and immediately complied which was great.\nThe ambience isn't anything to sing with delight about. Just Galle being Galle. Well, that area at least. There are little tables and chairs you can sit at and an upstairs area which we didn't have the time to visit. Lots of couples, families and tourists stop here.\nSadly, Pedlar's Gelato wasn't as promising as the hype built it out to be. At least for me. If I've upset any fanatics then I'd like a serving of their original stuff so I can judge, but otherwise this is how it went.\nDO try the chocolate ice cream though, it was delicious.\nPedlar's Inn Gelato is a popular spot for warding off the sunny blues with ice cream. They've sadly declined in quality, though.\nPedlar's still does some good gelato, but it's not as  great as it used to be.\nGelato down Pedlar's Street\n",
