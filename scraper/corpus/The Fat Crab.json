  "review": "The Fat Crab on Marine Drive is well known for their seafood. They've also got a Mongolian section by the name of Genghis BBQ. We tried both of their offerings and they were pretty good.\nThe Fat Crab is an unpretentious seafood bistro that is a valuable addition to the growing restaurant scene along Marine Drive and fills the need for a mid-range crab specialist in Colombo.\n",
