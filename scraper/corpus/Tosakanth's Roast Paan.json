  "review": "Tosakanth's which we first came across a couple of years ago at the Colombo Design Market finally has their own outlet on De Fonseka Road. Their stuffed roast paan are an interesting take on the local staple and now they've introduced some new drinks go with it.\nOn our visit they had a few variants of the stuffed roast paan avaialble; the classic Pol Sambol with Cheese, Chilli Chicken, Cajun chiken with cranberry and Fully Loaded.\nThe Ambul Thiyal we tried last year, seem to have been discontinued. Prices range from Rs. 200 - Rs. 450 and we think it's not too bad for the most part since the portions are quite filling.\nThe Pol Sambol and Cheese (Rs. 200) had an abundance of spicy and tangy pol sambol which was excellent. Coupled with the well toasted, crunchy bread it really does give you that classic pol sambol and paan flavour. However, there really wasn't enough cheese, and I was only able to taste it for a couple of bites.\nThe Chili Chicken (Rs. 300) was our favorite. You're getting that same excellent bread coupled with the herbs and flavors of the spices and plenty of minced chicken. It was really delicious and the balance of spices and texture was just right.\nThe Fully Loaded (Rs. 450) sounded more exciting than it actually was. We were hoping for an all meat sandwich but we got was the combo of the two flavours we just mentioned.  You get a lot of stuffing here, but at Rs. 450 we think it's a bit too pricey and the combination itself will be a hit or miss depending a lot on personal preference. We'd honestly suggesting getting the two flavours separately since it's only Rs. 50 more for double the portion of bread.\nThey have quite a few drinks like Emerald Dragon, Lemongrass, Tinkiri Tea and Iced Milo.\nThe Iced Milo (Rs. 250) was not the best we have tried and definitely on the pricier end of the ice milo spectrum. We'd love to have seen more milo in their, but that can be easily fixed. That being said, it does work particularly well with the roast paan so they're definitely on to something.\nThe Scintillating  Lemongrass Tea (Rs. 250), on the other hand, is a warm lemongrass tea. It's fine as a stand alone tea and perfect if you're suffering from a sore throat, but it doesn't really work that well with the sandwiches.\nIt's just Tosakanth handling the orders and the prepping, so our food took a quite a while to arrive. Either way, she's friendly and all smiles with the same attention to detail that we came across two years ago. Always great to see a homecook opening up their own space.\nThere are only a couple of seating near the counter, but you can also sit inside the Sugar Shack. The small area is very cute with wooden walls painted in shades of blue and white with a blackboard menu on the corner. It was also noticeably clean.\nWe're really glad to see Tosakanth's Roast Paan finally get their own space. They've still got a few areas for improvement when it comes to their stuffings but their sandwiches are a solid choice if you're looking for an inexpensive filling meal.\nGood old Roast Paan to satisfy those tastebuds.\nIf you'd like something unconventional yet traditional for breakfast, check these guys out.\n\n\u0d85\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d92 \u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0db4\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0daf\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0db8\u0dca \u0dc3\u0d82\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9c\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0dda \u0da7\u0ddc\u0dc3\u0dcf\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0dca\u2019\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0db4\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda.\n\n\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dc3\u0dca \u0db4\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dc0 \u0dad\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2, \u0d94\u0dba \u0d91\u0d9a \u0d91\u0d9a \u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dbd\u0da7 \u0dc4\u0daf\u0dbd. \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd0\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0dc4\u0daf\u0dbd \u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dda\u0da7 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0db1\u0dd1.\n",
