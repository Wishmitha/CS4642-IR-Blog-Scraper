  "description": "Consider yourself a bona fide carnivore? Well then Backyard BBQ is just what you're looking for. They're a barbecue specialist in Mt.Lavinia that does delivery and take-out. They've got a great selection of western barbecue at a pretty good price.",
  "tip": "Make sure you ask them about the preparation of the racks because they've got names like Kansas City and St.Louis, which can be a bit confusing when you look at the menu.",
