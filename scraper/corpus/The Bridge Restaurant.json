  "description": "Located in Kitulgala, the Kitulgala Rest House is just over two hours by car, or about three hours by bus, from Colombo. With a touch of 'old-world charm' the rest house is the perfect place to relax in style after a day of whitewater or hiking in what's fast becoming Sri Lanka's adventure capital",
  "tip": "If you're there on a weekend and feeling hungry don't miss the authentic Sri Lankan buffet lunch (Rs.850), good value for the selection and quality of dishes on offer. Choose a table at the rear of the restaurant overlooking the Kelani River below. Take your swimwear and have a dip in the river afterwards.",
