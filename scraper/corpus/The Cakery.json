  "review": "The Cakery has been an all-time favourite amongst the staff here at YAMU and it only makes sense for me to try them out what with all the hype. We dropped in on a gloomy Tuesday and unfortunately, they didn't live up to the hype (TRUST NO ONE).\nThey've introduced an all day breakfast menu which means they've got a range of pancakes, bagels and other types of breakfast fare available throughout the day. They're also running a promotion where your second breakfast item gets 50% off, so that's a perk.\nThe Salmon Bagel (Rs. 680) came toasted, stuffed with a generous portion of salmon and cream cheese. While it looks appetising the initial bite left us wondering why life is full of illusions because the bagel was tough. A real pity because it would have made an otherwise delectable treat, but bid adieu to your dentures if you wish to indulge.\nThe Peaches and Cream French Toast (Rs. 280 on account of the special discount) had us baffled as to what it\nwas because it was so horrendously undercooked, it tasted much like a bland custard rather than french toast. The only saving grace were the peach slices. The cream was fresh and light but sadly did nothing to salvage the rest of the elements in this dish.\nThe Lemon and Blueberry Cake (Rs. 280 by the slice) was once my all-time favourite slice of goodness. However, the glace icing strongly tasted of egg yolk which is an absolute no-no and I regret to report that we didn't find this appetising at all.\nThe Chocolate Cake (Rs. 180) wasn't so bad compared to the rest. The cake was moist albeit rather crumbly, and the icing was more of a thick ganache that hits the spot if you're looking for something heavily chocolatey.\nThe Mocha (Rs. 440) was a strange concoction because it had an adequate amount of chocolate in it but had a distinct coconut-y flavour seeping through. The coffee is heavily diluted by a lot of water which makes it easy to drink but not easy to enjoy.\nThe Macchiato (Rs. 380) was surprisingly nice but it wasn't really an actual macchiato. There was an adequate amount of espresso but way too much milk \u2014 not exactly dotted. I recommend you get this if you're looking to wash the cake down with a caffeine hit.\nThe Cakery hasn't really changed in terms of ambience save for a few switches in seating areas here and there. The place is massive with plenty of seating for about 50+ people, and they've also got an outdoor seating area that's quite pretty with cement tables and benches. Upstairs on the balcony is another seating area decked out with giant blue umbrellas and an exceedingly dirty tiled floor, so if you don't mind the crows then it's a cool place to chill at with a group of friends. In addition to all this, they have a play area for children upstairs, and they're known for hosting a few workshops for kids so call them up if you're interested.\nThe service though, good grief, was in all honesty shabby at best. The staff seemed to be having a jolly old time behind the counter, quipping jokes at each other and other fun activities. Despite being friendly, the service is heavily in need of some touching up, as our food took about 40 minutes to get to our table in spite of having cakes and whatnot ready-made. Also a side note: they're very good at taking 3-4 orders at once over the counter and conveniently forgetting/messing up. It didn't help that the dishes and mugs were dirty and stained.\nSpeaking of convenience, it'd be a real treat to work here because it seems that the staff are granted unrestricted access to the pantry. The servers are known for helping themselves to the food and drink which must be real nice. While the bill was being settled, the server was helping themselves to a handsome snack (a salmon bagel) which I found tremendously advantageous, especially since peasants like me have to pay for our food.\nIt appears that when Bhagya visited them three days prior to us, everything was fine. So watch out, the service here is erratic at best. Nevertheless in an effort to be fair, I will say go right ahead and try their range of cakes. Here's hoping they get back on their feet soon and return to their glory days.\nThe Cakery was a massive hit amongst the YAMU staff back in the day but they've slowly declined in terms of service and food.\nThe Cakery is amazing. There's almost nothing to complain about, and everything to like.\nThe Cakery by The English Cake Company is one of the most popular spots in Colombo for fresh baked cakes. A few things have changed since our last visit, but the cakes are still good.\nThe Cakery used to be a resident favourite amongst the plebs at office, but they've long since dwindled in terms of service and food.\nThe Cakery used to be a resident favourite amongst the plebs at office, but they've long since dwindled in terms of service and food.\n",
