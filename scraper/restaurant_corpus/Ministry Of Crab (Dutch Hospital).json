  "review": "Ministry Of Crab is probably Colombo's best restaurant. From quality of ingredients to character to location, this Dharshan Munidasa joint has it all. It even has celebrity co-owners in Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena. More than anything else, however, people come here for the crab. It ain't cheap, but it is delicious.\nThere's also some new stuff on the menu. They have fresh fish (grouper) for under Rs. 1,000 and clams and oysters. We tried the clams (Rs. 680). They came in a rich butter sauce and we had plenty of them. Good value, and we used the butter sauce for bread as well.\nAnother classic is the clay pot prawn curry (Rs. 2,480). This is prawn like you've never seen it, with two unfurled ones in there. It's a lot of prawn meat and a delicious hodi.\nDefinitely worth noting are the side dishes at Min Crab. This is the pol sambol, which is authentic and delicious. We also tried the amazing garlic and leek fried rices, kade paan (bread) and kangkun garlic and egg, but fingers were way too messy at that point to take photos.\nWe went with a vegetarian friend and (though we wouldn't recommend it) he was quite happy just feasting on the sides.\nOverall the damage came to Rs. 19,000 for 5 people, or 3,800 per person. At about $30 USD this is quite a good value for tourists, which is who we went with. It is definitely expensive for locals, however, but you are getting consistently excellent value.\nDrinks wise they serve an excellent Small Island Iced Tea - an arrack cocktail - for Rs. 400 as well as Hendricks gin and tonics and wine and beer.\nThe Dutch Hospital is Sri Lanka's best new development and Ministry Of Crab is its centerpiece. You can dine on the verandah or inside the large communal style dining room (it has big tables where you seat near other guests).\nIt's a simple and beautiful space and completes the whole experience.\nDinner at Ministry Of Crab remains one of the best experiences in the city. It's really tasty, exciting and fun. Expensive, but we highly recommend.\nDinner at Ministry Of Crab remains one of the best experiences in the city. It's really tasty, exciting and fun.
