  "description": "Colombo has a ton of Chinese eateries, but Tong Ni BBQ hidden away on Walukarama Road (behind Subway), is one that is truly unique. The food is good and you get to see it being cooked right on your table. It may not suit everyone but we found it entertaining.",
  "tip": "Make sure you ask the waiter for an apron since oil does tend to splash a bit when the BBQ is on.",
