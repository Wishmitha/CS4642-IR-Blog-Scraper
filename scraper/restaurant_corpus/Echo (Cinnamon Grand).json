  "description": "Colombo wants for good Italian options. While there\u2019s no lack of Italian restaurants none of them quite does justice to the real gusti d\u2019italia  It\u2019s not that Bayleaf, Il Ponte, Echo are bad exactly \u2013 just that they aren\u2019t quite good enough. On occasion though Colombo\u2019s wannabe trattorias can surprise you with the quality of their cooking. The other day we stepped into Echo and discovered they serve up a very respectable anti pasti buffet for Rs. 1200+. ",
  "tip": "Stick to the antipasti buffet, the mains arent worth it. Good for vegetarians.  The limo soda was exceptional.",
