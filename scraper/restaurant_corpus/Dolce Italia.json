  "review": "Dolce Italia's new spot on Skelton Road is indicative of the brand maturing. Gone are the plastic tables and bright green decor of their old premises, the new spot is a cosy space with lots of seating, lots of staff, and even a pizza oven.\nWe decided to get one of our old Dolce favourites, the Shrimp Fettuccine (Rs. 1150). The waiter suggested red sauce, so we went with that. Slightly al dente, with oodles of fragrant and herby tomato-based sauce, the pasta was great, and surprisingly filling.\nThey've got a whole new pizza menu now, so we decided to check out a couple of their toppings. We opted for half Quattro Formaggio (Rs. 1400) and half Pollo Spezie (Rs. 1300) upon the waiter's recommendation. Altogether, the pizza came to Rs. 1350. The 4 cheese was quite good, with a selection of imported cheeses including blue cheese gracing the light and thin base.\nThe spicy chicken topping was quite disappointing, as it basically tasted like curry and was so wet it soaked through the base giving it a roti-like consistency. Italian chicken curry and roti is not something you want to experience.\nThe management noticed our pizza and told us the spicy chicken was a poor choice (we kind of wish they'd told the waiter this first!), and insisted on sending out a couple more pizzas for us to taste. They wouldn't charge us for these (clearly being a YAMU reviewer is no longer an anonymous profession), so we're not going to review them in detail. The Dolce special features a full fried egg hidden under two sheets of rubbery chicken bacon. The other is a veg-friendly Quattro Stagioni (without the traditional ham and salami).\nThey also insisted we try their kurakkan pizza, which was superb in its simplicity. Think of it as a starter or healthy replacement for garlic bread. In fact, you can use kurakkan as a base for any of the pizzas if you ask.\nAs before, Dolce doesn't serve any alcohol, but they don't mind if you bring in a bottle of wine. Their drinks selection are the usual ice tea, soft drinks, and coffee, although they've invested in a shiny new coffee machine.\nWe tried an ice tea (Rs. 100) and lime soda (a tad pricey at Rs. 350), along with a cappuccino (also Rs. 350). The tea and soda were fine, straightforward cold drinks perfect for the heat.\nFrothy, strong, and not burnt, the cappuccino was enjoyable. They use Guatemalan Arabica capsules in their machine rather than beans in order to maintain consistency.\nTheir tiramisu (Rs. 350) is a real steal at that price, because it's packed with quality ingredients and prep. We highly recommend it, along with their other pastries, profiteroles, and eclairs (all around the same price).\nThe service here has always been friendly and efficient. The waiters are very nice, but they're not always well-versed in Italian cuisine so you might want to speak to the owners/management if you want recommendations.\nThe new ambience is lovely. A converted Colombo 5 house, the new Dolce has lots of space, seating, and natural light. There's also lots of stuff you can choose from their bakery/pastry section.\nI'm personally not a fan of pork-substitute products (like substituting bacon with chicken bacon or pepperoni with cut up bits of chicken sausage), but I understand Dolce's decision to keep their customers of different faiths happy. I really recommend trying out their kurakkan base, their pasta, or even just stopping in for a pastry and coffee. This is probably the most reasonable spot for good Italian fare in the city.\nOur look at Dolce Italia's new premises on Skelton Road.\nWe love the desserts here. Their pastas aren't half bad either.\nDolce Italia is a lovely little Italian restaurant cum bakery in Bamba. They do Italian favourites that are both authentic and affordable.\nDolce Italia is a new little bakery cum restaurant run by two Italians. They've got some very nice Italian pastries and breads, and the prices aren't too crazy.\n\n\u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8 \u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0da7\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1.\n\n\u0db8\u0dcf  \u0dc4\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0ddc\u0dc6\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dbb\u0ddd\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d85\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dc3 \u0db8\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0db8\u0db1\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0da0\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dbd\u0da7\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dc3\u0dba \u0d89\u0dc3\u0dca\u0db8\u0dad\u0dd4 \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dda \u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dc3\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0daf\u0dca\u0daf\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dba.  \u0d9a\u0dbb \u0d9a\u0dbb \u0d9c\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db4\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0db6\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca\u0d9a\u0da7\u0dca \u0db8\u0dad \u0d9d\u0db1\u0dc0 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd6 \u0da0\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dbd\u0da7\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0db4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dc3\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0daf \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dba \u0da7\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dd4 \u0dad\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dca\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0dd0\u0dc4\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dd4 \u0d85\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0db4\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0ddc\u0dc0\u0dd3\u0dba.\n",
