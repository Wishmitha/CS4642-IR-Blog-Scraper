  "review": "Candy Cakes is another home baker that specializes in jars (our other favourite jar bakers are\nand\n). What's different is that they also stuff jars full of candy.\nMore good news: they deliver, through\n(though there's nothing quick about Quickee - my order took almost two hours).\nWe asked for an assortment of candy in one jar (Rs. 650), and a Fero-Choc cake jar (Rs. 560). This is a little pricey for a quick dessert, but jars are generally expensive, except for maybe\nthat does it for Rs. 250, but we think Candy Cakes brownies taste better. Candy Cakes has certain cake jars for Rs. 400 and candy ones for Rs. 280.\nTheir cake jar menu is small with typical options like red velvet and strawberry shortcake. The Fero-Choc cake jar basically tastes like brownies and cream, except with sprinklings of Ferrero-Rocher biscuit on the top and in between. There isn't much of a strong Ferrero chocolate flavour in it, so it's like getting a jar of brownies and cream - totally delicious either way, and surprisingly we had enough to share between two though it was small in size.\nCandy Cakes is a home baker that does good brownie jars and candy assortments, so they've definitely got our vote. So if you're looking for desserts and want it delivered to your door, these confectioners are worth considering.\n",
