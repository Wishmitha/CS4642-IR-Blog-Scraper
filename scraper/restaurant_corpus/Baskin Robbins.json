  "description": "The ice cream was pretty tasty. Creamy not overly synthetic- the fig flavour had the satisfying stickiness of real dried figs and while the cookies and cream didn\u2019t taste exactly like a cookie it was a good ice-creamy impersonation. ",
  "tip": "As an added bonus they also have Rubicon juice- Rs 160.  Its apparently a Cyprus brand but the tropical juice flavours -Guava, Lychee, Mango etc are popular in the UK.",
