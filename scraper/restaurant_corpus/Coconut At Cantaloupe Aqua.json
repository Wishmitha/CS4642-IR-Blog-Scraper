  "description": "I can understand the appeal of Aqua to a certain clientele. It's probably a good place for a party. The beach isn't always swimmable, but there's a nice area where you can drinks some cocktails, watch the waves or even lounge in the plunge pool without getting your hair wet. And they play some decent music. But it's certainly not worth travelling too far out of your way for in terms of food.",
  "tip": "We didn't like the mixed seafood grill. The jumbo prawn was fine, but the rest was pretty poor quality - the fish tasted sour and it was served cold. Don't get this. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to arrange outdoor dining on request (the person on the phone seems very hospitable)",
