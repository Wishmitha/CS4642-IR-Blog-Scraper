  "review": "Family Baker is arguably the best mainstream bakery in Mount Lavinia. They've got a great selection of both savories and sweets, which have been consistently tasty time and time again.\nOne thing they do particularly well are pies. These are priced between Rs. 80 - Rs. 100 for a sizeable portion. They're also quite accurate when it comes to the description of fillings. When they say chicken and mushroom or mutton pie, you're not going to be disappointed when you bite into it.\nIf you're looking for quality baked goods in Mount Lavinia, Family Baker is a solid choice. Their pies, kimbula banis and white sauce rolls are all excellent choices.\n",
