  "review": "Schakasz opened up last year as one of Colombo\u2019s only dedicated dessert bars. They had a pretty good start, and one year down the line they\u2019ve really come into their own as one of our favourite dessert spots in Colombo.\nFor the longest time Colombo didn\u2019t have many dedicated dessert spots other than the ice cream parlours. Things have changed for the better in the past few years with the surge of home bakers and the Good Market graduates, with some of our favourites like\n,\nand\nall opening their own spaces. Though relatively new compared to the others, Schakasz has really stepped up their game over the course of the last year. Their menu tends to change a bit regularly, though they have do have mainstays like the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate madness. Their prices are on the mid to high end with most dishes falling between Rs. 300 - Rs. 500, but their portions are generous, so it\u2019s totally worth it.\nWe started with their Hot Chocolate (Rs. 430), which is probably one of the richest and most chocolatey you\u2019ll come across in the city. Yes, Rs. 430 is pricey but this is one ginormous mug, easily enough for two. We liked the fact that this wasn\u2019t very sweet since it\u2019s meant to be had with a dessert. The marshmallows were also a welcome addition, complementing the thickness of the hot chocolate.\nSchakasz\u2019s Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Cheesecake (Rs. 450) is probably my favourite dessert in Colombo right now. I\u2019ve had this on five separate occasions and it has been on point each time. This combines the best of both the dishes with a crunchy biscuit base, rich custard and cream cheese centre, topped with burnt caramel and frozen raspberries. The reason this dish works so well is because of the perfect contrast between textures, temperatures and flavours.\nYou get a light crunch from the burnt caramel, followed by the smoothness of the cream cheese custard center and finally the texture and ever so subtle savouriness of the biscuit base. The frozen raspberries may seem like a small addition but they do wonders by adding a burst of acidity and freshness along with a coolness right before the warm burnt caramel.\nTheir Kahlua cheesecake (Rs. 450) was recommended to us by a bunch of people and it delivered. This is basically a classic cheesecake with a generous layer of Kahlua mousse on top. We appreciated the fact that the Kahlua wasn\u2019t overstated here.\nThat being said, this is still adequately boozy, with the cream cheese layer balancing it out well. We\u2019ve also had their no-bake cheesecake which is also great, making Schakasz one of Colombo\u2019s best spots for cheesecake.\nTheir strawberry panna cotta jar (Rs. 380) is also a solid choice. You can\u2019t really judge the consistency of the panna cotta until you really get in there, but we found it to be just right with that little wobble we always look for. The layer of strawberry coulis is a bit tough to reach, but it had a nice tartness which offset the rich panna cotta well.\nThe only thing we weren\u2019t too crazy about was the Chocolate Fudge Cake (Rs. 450) which was a bit on the dry side. This actually wasn\u2019t bad but it kinda fell short compared to the others. This had a layer of cake, followed by cream and a fudge base. The problem was that both the cake and the base were quite dry. The cream helped a bit but we think it could have been a bit sweeter to offset the heavy chocolate flavour.\nThe look and feel of Schakasz has remained mostly unchanged during the past year. Located on Stratford Avenue, it\u2019s easy to spot with white walls and quirky window doodles. It\u2019s still mostly a take-out kind of spot, but they do have two tables set up inside with seating for around ten, and a few tables set up outside as well.\nFor a small dessert bar, Schakasz actually has quite a few people working behind the counter, but that\u2019s partly because they do all the baking on location. The folks there were welcoming and really friendly, which is all we can really ask since there isn\u2019t much else in terms of service to consider here.\nSchakasz has become one of our go-to spots for a sweet fix with their innovative and consistently excellent dishes. If you\u2019re craving a great cheesecake, you\u2019ll want to stay here for a while.\nOne year down the line, Schakasz  has really come into their own, and is one of our favourite dessert spots in Colombo.\nSchakasz is a little cafe in Kirulapone exclusively for desserts.
