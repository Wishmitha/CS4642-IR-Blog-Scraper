  "review": "There aren't many places to eat on the stretch between Tangalle and\nHambantota, and Kash's Kitchen in Ambalantota is a welcome sight\nfor any traveller looking for sustenance. The facade is modern glass panes,\nthe food is affordable and served in a buffet table, and most importantly:\nthe place is exceedingly clean.\nKash's Kitchen is a pastry shop as well as a restaurant. They have a range of\nshort eats to choose from, in addition to the numerous types of rice-based\nmeals on offer. Red rice, Samba rice, various types of fried rices,\nnoodles, biriyani and lamprais are on the menu.\nThe main attraction though, is the lunch buffet. You get to pick either\nred rice or white rice, and several types of curries including fish and\nchicken. For Rs. 380 you get to serve as much as you wish, or you can\nchoose to pay Rs. 250 and still get a portion served by the staff. The\nbuffet version also includes a dessert, which on the day we dined was\nwatalappan.\nWhile the Kash's Kitchen is ostensibly a \"self service\" restaurant,\nthe owners are always there, and offer friendly and helpful service.\n",
