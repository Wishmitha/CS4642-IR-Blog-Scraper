  "review": "Sri Lanka is a rare country where German/Swiss cuisine is the height of finer dining rather than, say, French.\nand the\nare old favorites, but their suburban cousin Sovereign is actually quite good.\nWe ordered the Pot Roast Pork (Rs. 1,200) and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Rs. 1,250) - both pricey but chock full of flavor and foodness (sheer quantity). Whatever you say about German food, it's not subtle. The pork was swimming in savory gravy and accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes and buttery carrots. The chicken had a slightly peppery bread crumb crust and a hot cheesy oozing creamy center. It came with mash and very savory mushrooms. The overall impression here is savory. There's no subtly here, it's just bang in the mouth with flavor.\nIt's really satisfying. There was a lot of food but we both cleaned our plates.\nWe went at lunch time when the place was relatively empty and the service was quite good. A German lady that seemed to be the owner also came out after and thoughtfully gave us some Center Shock gum. The staff is attentive without hovering, they're good.\nSituated on the Nawala Road near Nugegoda, Sovereign isn't exactly central, but for people in suburbs including Battaramulla, it's far closer than a trip into town.\nPrepare for overeating and feelings of great contented sleepiness. Sovereign is a worthy alternative to the city's Germanic fare. It's got savory, hefty portions, decent service and makes for an excellent if food-coma-inducing meal.\nSovereign German Restaurant is pretty good. They serve extremely hearty German fare in a kitschy but welcoming location in Nugegoda.\n\n\u0dc3\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0da2\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db8\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dd9\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0ddc\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca \u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0db3 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d91\u0dba \u0db1\u0dd4\u0d9c\u0dda\u0d9c\u0ddc\u0da9 \u0d86\u0dc3\u0dcf \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2, \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0db6\u0dd0\u0dba\u0dd2 \u0d91\u0dad\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u0db8\u0d9a\u0db6\u0dc0\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0dad\u0dd0\u0db1\u0d9a\u0dca.\n",
