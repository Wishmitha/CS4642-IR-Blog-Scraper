  "review": "Santor\u00e9 Bistro Italiano is an Italian restaurant hidden behind the Sri Lanka Tennis Association. It's one of Colombo's better options for Italian fare, serving up stellar pizza and a range of pasta. They are relatively new to the scene, but they've built a good reputation over the years, amassing a formidable customer base that you can bear witness to on a Saturday evening. We dropped in for dinner to try out their pasta and secondi, as we generally try their pizzas and those have never disappointed.\nWe started off with Bruschetta Santor\u00e9 (Rs 375). You get two pieces of bread with tomato sauce, mozzarella and capers with some oregano sprinkled on top. I personally prefer bruschetta when it's got diced tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella, so this wasn't satisfactory.\nSince they make their own pasta, we tried the Tortellini Panna E Prosciutto (Rs 1300). It's a tiny little pasta that's filled with minced beef, minced pork and mortadella. It's usually served with white cream but we were advised that it can be a little heavy and take away from the actual flavour of the filling, so we opted for olive oil and parmesan instead. If you're feeling fancy, you can ask for truffle oil and they will indulge you.\nFor meat, we tried the Filetto Di Maiale Al Miele (Rs 1400). Basically, pork fillet with a honey glaze served with potatoes. There's lots of rosemary and cumin that really livens up this dish. We found the pork to be a bit tough, but it was still quite delicious. It's just enough for two to share, if you've ordered something else as well.\nOur dessert featured the Tortino Al Cuore Morbido (Rs 700). It's basically a lava cake, and hands down the best one I've had. The chocolate is not too sweet and it's so soft on the outside and gooey on the inside. We wish they would make their own gelato, though, as the ice cream was just average.\nThe staff at Santor\u00e9 have improved. Ask for Sanath as he's well-versed with the menu. On most days, they'll get your food to you pretty quick. Fridays and Saturdays tend to be packed, though, so service can suffer. The ambiance is pretty chilled out. You can watch them prepare the pizza if you sit indoors, or, if it's earlier in the evening, the outdoor area is nice.\nHaving tried the pasta and meat options, we think Santor\u00e9 is best for their pizza. They are a bistro, so you can't expect five-star hotel service from them, but their staff is quite capable. They do delivery even in the pouring rain, which is pretty commendable.\nSantor\u00e9 Bistro Italiano is one of Colombo's better options for Italian fare, serving up stellar pizza and a range of pasta.\nIn the latter half of 2013, Santor\u00e9 was the newest Italian restaurant to join the fray. They've got high quality ingredients, authentic cuisine and a great location at the Tennis Association. We liked them then, and that hasn't changed after our second visit.\nThis Italian restaurant imports the best ingredients (including an amazing pizza oven) and is manned by actual Italians. Top it off with a beautiful, verdant location and intelligent staff and you have a real treat hidden in Colombo 7.\n\n\u0dc3\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dca\u0da7\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dbd\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dc6\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dca\u0da7\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d91\u0d9a \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dda \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0da7\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dbb\u0dca\u0da7\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dc5\u0d9f \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0daf\u0dd2\u0db8 \u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0d85\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d92\u0d9a\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc3\u0db1 \u0dc4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dad\u0db8\u0dba \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd3\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc1\u0dd2\u0dc2\u0dca\u0da7 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dca\u0dc3\u0dcf, \u0d9a\u0daf\u0dd2\u0db8 \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dc0\u0dca\u200d\u0dba \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0dda\u0db8 \u0db6\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dba\u0db8\u0dab\u0dca\u0da9\u0dbd\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf. \u0d92\u0d9a \u0daf\u0dd0\u0db1\u0da7\u0db1\u0db8\u0dca \u0dc4\u0ddc\u0dba\u0dcf\u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0da7\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dba\u0dd2. \u0d92\u0d9a\u0dad\u0dca \u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u0dba\u0dda\u0db8 \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2 \u0dad\u0daf\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0db8 \u0dbb\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0db8\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d92\u0d9a.\n",
