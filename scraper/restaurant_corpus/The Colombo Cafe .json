  "description": "The Colombo Caf\u00e9  is a new competitor in Colombo\u2019s caf\u00e9 square off. While the prices of sandwiches and shakes can put your wallet on the endangered list, their Sri Lankan Buffet deal is the best deal we\u2019ve come across.",
  "tip": "Their lunchtime buffet is a good deal.",
  "review": "Currently known as \"The Sandwich Club\", they\u2019ll be changing their name to The Colombo Caf\u00e9 soon. Their menu features a variety of sandwiches, burgers, subs and wraps along with a few basic desserts and drinks.\nWith the wrap stumped for an okay three-runs, next up the batting order was their orange juice (Rs. 250). This tasted pretty ordinary so I wouldn\u2019t be bowled over by it. This one - much like a certain cricketer at the end of his career - goes just short of a duck - two.\nWith a lot of pressure on the game came the Banana Fillet (Rs. 350). This was the dark horse. It\u2019s essentially a banana split, with a crazy amount of sprinkles and an assortment of ice cream flavours. Kids might enjoy this one. The serving of banana could have been better though. The last man performed as good as the first \u2013 three.\nThe caf\u00e9 itself is pretty stylish. It\u2019s got comfy seating upstairs though you might feel a little isolated there. It seems like a popular place for office crowds (a few guys came to hire it for a small function while I was there).\nThey\u2019ve got free WIFI for their customers and therefore score a few points on my board. Service is efficient and the manager and his crew are helpful. They do run a tight ship however, with only three including the chef serving customers.\nThe Colombo Caf\u00e9 does a good take on some of their dishes, though the price will leave you expecting a wow element, which I found absent. The buffet however comes highly recommended.\n",
