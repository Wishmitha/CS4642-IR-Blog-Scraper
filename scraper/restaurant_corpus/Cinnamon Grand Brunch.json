  "description": "Whether you're just visiting Colombo or you live here, the Cinnamon Grand Brunch is a must visit. This lavish Sunday luncheon has long been a tradition with many Colombo families who, after church or a Sunday lie in, drive over to spend their afternoon ensconced in the Taprobane restaurant amidst cascading chocolate fountains, silver platters of oysters and glistening legs of lamb.\n",
  "tip": "This is really good value for money at just Rs. 1900 for unlimited quantities of just about any food you can think of, all at very high quality. Compare this to the very average lunch buffet at <a href=\"http://www.yamu.lk/place/akasa-kade/\" title=\"Akasa Kade\" target=\"_blank\">Akasa Kade</a> which costs almost Rs. 1000. ",
