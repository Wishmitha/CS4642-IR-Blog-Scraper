  "review": "Road side joints like Pilawoos have all the flair of  Flea Bottom (GOT fans unite!). There's a mess on your table from the previous diner that hasn't been cleaned up; there's an endless rush of bodies swarming towards the cashier, and even two cops enjoying a few\n(I assume, since there weren't any doughnuts to be seen). There's also piles of crushed paper on a muddy-tiled floor \u2014 Pilawoos is street food central.\nPilawoos (the most popular one) does good food, albeit lacking cleanliness. But it's street food, so we're not complaining.\nHotel De Pilawoos is one of the most popular 24 hour eateries named Pilawoos. Believe it or not, this is a big category; there are at least 10 Pilawoos in Colombo. The brand has become diluted and YAMU writers have gotten indigestion trying to figure out the best one. The original was supposedly in Maradana and is long gone. This is the Bambalapitiya Pilawoos and it's OK, definitely central. It's gentrifying fast.\n\n\u0dc4\u0ddc\u0da7\u0dd9\u0dbd\u0dca \u0da9\u0dd2 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dba 24\u0db8 \u0d87\u0dbb \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd9\u0db1 \u0d89\u0dad\u0dcf \u0da2\u0db1\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db6\u0ddc\u0da2\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0db8\u0dd9\u0dba \u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0da2\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca. \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd1\u0db8\u0dc4\u0dbd\u0dca 10\u0d9a\u0dca \u0db4\u0db8\u0dab \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc5\u0db9 \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf.\n",
