  "description": "On the Attidiya Road, there\u2019s a small spot that has the best vegetarian food I\u2019ve had in Sri Lanka. Perhaps the best Sri Lankan food. For Rs. 150 you get unlimited rice, kos, pollos, eggplant, potato or whatever they have on offer, plus homemade achcharu, lunuthe and papadum.",
