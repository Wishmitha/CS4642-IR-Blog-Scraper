  "review": "Cherries is a  small shop down Duplication Road that looks quite fun and appealing. It's got a large red signboard right outside and a glass exterior advertising waffles and free Wifi.\nRun by an incredibly friendly and helpful guy behind the counter, Cherries is a cosy, affordable, and well air-conditioned space that's a blessing in the middle of Duplication Road. There's a table, a couple of high stools and a small couch, magically fitting just right.\nTheir menu is largely a ton of fresh juices, smoothies, ice-creams, and a couple of waffle options: strawberry and kiwi. I haven't really had kiwi waffles here, so asked for a portion of that. It's Rs. 400.\nI was quite surprised to see the effort that went into it and how it was a lot more than I expected: the waffle was coated with a smooth layer of whipped cream and plenty of sliced kiwi, drizzled with chocolate sauce topped off with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. The waffle was piping hot and this contrasted nicely with the ice-cream. Its texture was a bit dense though, it wasn't light or fluffy at all.\nThe Orange Juice (Rs. 290) was pretty great. Fresh, chilled, and in a tall glass, it had just the right amount of sweetness and wasn't watered down.\nI asked for an espresso, and even though the menu mentions it, (along with cappuccinos and a couple of other options) they haven't gotten the machines yet, so they've only got black coffee. It was Nescafe, so I passed.\nLocated between the British Council and the Bambalapitiya Junction, this is a convenient spot to grab a quick drink and something to munch on. They haven't got much food-wise, but plan on introducing a couple of wraps over the next month.\n",
