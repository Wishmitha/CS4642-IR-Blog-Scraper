  "review": "The Bread Company was one of our favourite new restaurants back in 2014. They've kept things fairly hush-hush in the recent past, but their bread is still excellent, they've expanded their menu with a bunch of new meat options and still manage to keep things pretty lean and healthy.\nBefore The Bread Company set up shop in Colombo, they first gained popularity at\nfor their breads. They initially set up their space in Thimbirigasyaya along with two other brands (\nand Green Chilli), but now they\u2019ve got the space to themselves. They haven't tried to change things up too much, but they\u2019ve introduced a number of new meat options, a few breakfast combos and desserts, all of which are homemade. Prices are on the mid to high end so expect to pay between Rs. 500 - Rs. 1000, but their stuff is very filling.\nTheir breads are probably still their best sellers with the sourdough, rye, multi seed and wholemeal going for Rs. 400 for 500g and the nutty going for Rs. 100 more. They start baking before the crack of dawn, so the breads are usually available as early as 6.45 AM.\nThe Bread Company was always good with their cured meats, but now they\u2019ve expanded on that introducing more variations of sausages (parsley mix, smoked), roast beef, baby back bacon and roast pork. We tried the smoked pork sausage and it was easily one of the best we\u2019ve had. The moment you taste this you know it\u2019s all pork with no fillers. The seasoning isn\u2019t too aggressive either, so the flavour of the pork really comes through with barely any fatty pieces.\nAll of their sandwiches are priced at Rs. 450, but these are larger than a burgers at most places. You can choose from any of the available meats so you\u2019ve got chicken, beef, pork and salmon. We chose the BLT and we like the fact that they let you choose either fresh tomatoes or tomato paste (which is what I went with). The two main factors here are the bread and the baby back bacon which along with the lettuce makes for brilliant combo of textures. The bacon was crispy but not overly oily or salty so the balance was also just right.\nThe Bread Company\u2019s main focus seems to be breakfast, so they offer some really hearty omelettes. At Rs. 900 it\u2019s pricey but these are packed full of veges and meat. What you see in the photo is actually a half portion which was plenty filling in itself. This one came with roast chicken, green and yellow peppers, onions and carrots.\nTheir peanut butter cups (Rs. 250) are a new addition, and a brilliant one at that. These are like Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups, only bigger and better! It\u2019s packed with chunky peanut butter which is lightly salty and sweet, with little crispy bits which make it so enjoyable. We caved and got another one to go..\nThey\u2019ve also introduced a German coffee as of late and it\u2019s quite good. We tried the macchiato (Rs. 350), which was creamier than contemporary cafe macchiatos. The coffee itself is not bitter at all so that\u2019s something to keep in mind when choosing which to go with.\nWhen The Bread Company first opened up, the space had barely any seating so most people were getting their food to go. Now they\u2019ve changed the entire set up rearranged the space so that there\u2019s seating for around twenty.\nThe service at TBC is as good as it gets. They\u2019re super friendly and they\u2019ll take the time to explain any details you want to know about the dishes or preparation of meats. It's a very personal experience which we wish was more common. Their also super fast so you won't find yourself waiting for more than ten minutes for your food to be ready.\nThe Bread Company is one of the few restaurants that\u2019s managed to maintain their high standards from the beginning. They\u2019re stuff isn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s incredibly high quality and they taste great.\nThe Bread Company does excellent breads, sausages, pickles and more, and they do some of the  best sandwiches in the city and a good breakfast if you want to dine in.\nWe love this place. The Bread Company does good dine-in options (hot dogs, sandwiches, burgers, salads, cinnamon buns) and wonderful things to take home (sausages, pickles, jams, bread).\nThe Bread Company does excellent breads, sausages, pickles and more, and they do the best hot dog in the city and a good breakfast if you want to dine in.\n",
