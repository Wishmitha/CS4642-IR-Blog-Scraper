  "review": "Shandong is a new Chinese restaurant in Rajagiriya, spearheaded by a few Industry veterans. They're one of the better choices when it comes to Sri Lankan Chinese delivery, though certain areas have plenty of room for improvement.\nWe're actually quite impressed that Shandong offers delivery so soon after its inception. Then again, having worked at the oldest Chinese restaurant chain in the country, the staff must be seasoned veterans. Even though they're located in Rajagiriya, Shandong delivers all around Colombo as well as the suburbs, and their delivery rates are very reasonable.\nAlthough it doesn't look to change the status quo, Shandong is a welcome addition to Colombo's Sri Lankanized Chinese scene. They definitely have their strengths but certain areas need looking into. They're still very new, so hopefully they can iron out the kinks.\n",
