  "description": "It was with cautious expectations that we visited the Kohuwela Roots. But here, we're happy to say, the service is good and the juices, superb. The little glass cube jutting out of Tisara Plaza is clean and nice; the staff don't stand around gormlessly and they can serve up a swift and delicious cold strawberry juice (Rs. 220).",
