  "review": "Ammi's Meaty Delights is a home cook that delivers Sri Lankan style meat dishes. We tried their beef, chicken and pork dishes and they all turned out be very satisfying.\nWe actually came across Ammi's Meaty Delights quite randomly while browsing through the Orderfood.lk list of restaurants, and thought we'd give it a try. The menu is small and very simple, with choices of beef, chicken and pork, each with a few preparations.\nSo at the moment the only way to order from Ammi's Meaty Delights is to call them through Orderfood.lk and have them deliver it. You'll need to order either a day in advance, or place the order early in order to have it delivered the same day. You can find their menu\n, but the rates are a bit outdated so expect to pay around Rs. 50 more.\nWhile the delivery is convenient and generally reliable, the process of making the order was painstaking in our case since the guy on the phone knew very little about the menu or their existence.\nTrue to the home cook code, Ammi's Meaty Delights offer great value for money and some tasty Sri Lankan style meat dishes. Classic home cooked meat curries delivered to your doorstep.\n",
