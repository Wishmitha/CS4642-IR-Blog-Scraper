  "review": "Jeorgie's is a new burger place in Nawala - their burgers are super stuffed and tall, and they make some awesome creamy fruit smoothies. However, there isn't anything 'healthy' about eating these oozing burgers, except maybe that the bread is whole wheat and the meat is unprocessed.\nThe place is on the same premises as\n- a big children's play pen. So this also happens to be a good place for a kids' party.\nDat burger. You may have noticed our objectification of the burgers here is not unlike what we did in our\n. These burgers aren't half as good as the RB ones though. Still, they are packed to the brim.\nWe got a chicken and a beef burger, Rs. 400 each, and there was egg, onions, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, greasy chilli sauce, and a gigantic slice of meat. They were alright, but honestly we could barely tell the difference between the chicken and the beef slices - they were just big greasy indistinct chunks of meat. It can be overwhelming, and if you're not famished, we suggest you get the mini-burgers instead. You get potato wedges with it.\nThe smoothies were perfect - we got avocado and mango. For Rs. 300 this was worth it.\nJeorgie's is just a simple outdoor space, next to the Fun Factory kids' play area. It's nice, though call beforehand if you're planning to sit-in, since the place might be booked for a children's party (hence all the decor in the picture above).\nService was quite good, with everything arriving in a few minutes and the manager asking us about the food.\nJeorgie's Healthy Style Foods is basically a burger and smoothie joint that does loaded okay-tasting burgers and great smoothies. The burgers are far from healthy options in the city (\n,\n), but if you're really hungry and want to go binge-snacking, this is not a bad option.\n",
