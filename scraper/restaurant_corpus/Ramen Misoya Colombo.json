  "review": "Ramen Misoya was a surprise addition to Colombo\u2019s Japanese scene a few months ago. We\u2019ve actually been there a whole bunch of times already so this review will breakdown what to expect from their ramen and other offerings.\nJapanese cuisine in Colombo is the most diverse it\u2019s ever been, but we've never had a ramen specialist. This is not to say that others don\u2019t offer it, in fact Kuuraku does a fine take on it and Nihonbashi is also be a strong bet. However, Ramen Misoya is the first place to dedicate themselves to Nippon\u2019s beloved noodle soup.\nThey offer a super simple menu with three types of ramen, served with either chicken, pork or veggies. The three types are slight variations of their miso based broth; Hokkaido (salty), Ise (malty) and Kara (spicy).\nWhichever meat/veggie option you choose you can go for either basic version (Rs. 1200) or the cha shu version (Rs. 1750). The main difference between the two being that the basic version will come with only minced meat, while the cha shu will have slices of meat added. Besides the meat, the ramen is served with udon noodles, fried onions, potato wedges and saut\u00e9ed vegetables.\nSri Lankans will probably have a predisposition to go for the spicy broth and it\u2019s not a bad choice at all, but what I\u2019d recommend is either the Ise or Hokkaido broth, since you can actually add the chilli paste to it separately to bring that heat. We tried out the Hokkaido and while it is salty, it wasn\u2019t overwhelming, balancing out well with the miso flavour and the chilli paste we added. The texture was also on point with a smooth texture which binds well to both the noodles and the meat.\nYou may think that a noodle soup won\u2019t be too filling, but Ramen Misoya\u2019s portions are substantial. In the case of the RM, it's because of the thick ramen noodle they use which are actually quite similar to udon in texture. It gives the dish a lot of body without making it overly starchy.\nDuring our visits to RM we\u2019ve tried the both the basic and the cha shu versions of their ramen with pork and chicken. While the basic version still comes with the minced meat, we found that it generally finishes mid-way through. The cha shu on the other hand comes with tender cuts of meat which makes it feel like more of a meal. On our first visit the pork belly was cooked perfectly with light sear marks, literally melting in the mouth after braising in the warm broth. The second time we had it the texture was slightly off but the flavour was still on point.\nDespite being a ramen specialist, Ramen Misoya actually does serve up a few other (non-ramen) starters, mains and desserts. This may seem a bit odd, but I\u2019d go so far as to say that these are actually their best offerings.\nThe chicken karaage (Rs. 700) is honestly some of the best fried chicken we\u2019ve had in the city. The batter is not too thick, with a brilliant savouriness that really brings out of the flavour of the soy and garlic marinate. The meat has also been perfectly cooked on each occasion that we\u2019ve tried it, so it\u2019s a great way to prep for the mains.\nWith a name like Ramen Misoya you wouldn\u2019t really expect them to serve up some of the best fried rice in Colombo, but that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve got. Their double pork cachan (Rs. 950) is hands down one of my favourite rice dishes in Colombo right now. Unlike other fried rice you\u2019d get around the city, this one is not too heavy on the veggies with a just a bit of chopped carrots and chives thrown in. Instead you\u2019re getting more egg and a real focus on the seasoning of the rice which has been consistent on each occasion. The best part, however, has to be the pork, which you\u2019re getting plenty of. It\u2019s a perfect ratio of lean and fatty cuts with a great balance of flavours.\nThe service at RM has been great each time we\u2019ve been there. Never have we found ourselves unattended to or looking for a waiter to place an order. Since the menu is small the waiters are also well versed with the dishes and they make an effort to make repeat customers feel welcome.\nThe space itself was the former Beehive by RnR. The new layout is quite simple with two floors of seating that can handle a decent capacity. Nothing there really screams Japanese but we\u2019re not too fussed. One thing we were happy to see was their massive, clean open kitchen. They seem to have a good process going since the food is generally read in under 15 minutes.\nRamen Misoya does good ramen and a surprisingly brilliant fried rice. For anyone with soupy cravings we\u2019d recommend going for their cha shu ramen, but if you just want a really good rice dish we\u2019d say their double pork/chicken fried rice is a must-try.\n",
