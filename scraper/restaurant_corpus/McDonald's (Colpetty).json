  "description": "As a food, McDonald's is pretty processed and nothing special, but as an experience it still has a real place in the global psyche. Sometimes you just want McDonald's. In that case the Colpetty outlet serves the usual McD fare with a few Sri Lankan twists.",
  "tip": null,
  "review": "McDonald's is McDonald's, but Sri Lankan franchises can vary widely. As franchises go, McDonald's is pretty reliable. They also have a range of Sri Lankan stuff, like McRice and the McSpicy and Seeni Sambol Bun.\nThe Seeni Sambol is on the breakfast menu (before 10:30 AM). It's already quite popular and it is interesting. Basically a bun and egg with seeni sambol inside. The McDonald's seeni sambol is a bit more like a katta sambol with sugar, honestly, since the onion isn't especially noticeable. The spiciness is a nice addition to breakfast. We hear that it's already outselling the traditional breakfast options.\r\n\r\nBesides that new offering, the McSpicy (chicken) is pretty good and they now have wings and wraps. McDonald's fries remain excellent.\nThe staff are well-trained and quite fast. Unlike in the abroad, McDonald's is a pretty good and relatively aspirational job in Sri Lanka and they get good people.\n",
