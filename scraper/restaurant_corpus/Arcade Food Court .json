  "description": "Since the only proper food courts we've had in the city have been at Crescat, Excel World, Liberty and Majestic City - it's with great relief that we welcome the new one at the brand spanking new Arcade Independence Square. We think the atmosphere especially and the food here is a little notch above that of your average Colombo food court.",
