  "description": "Flavoured at Cinnamon Red, with their lean luxury theme, offers a curated menu with good variations at reasonable prices. They've got a good view of Colombo, tasty mains and excellent desserts, albeit with slightly slow service.",
  "tip": "Stick to the western mains",
  "review": "Cinnamon Hotels usually come with around two or three restaurants, most of which are priced in the higher end of the spectrum. Cinnamon Red, however, has just the one restaurant on their 8th floor named Flavoured, which manages to offer a decent selection while also being affordable. They serve a buffet for dinner but we tried their\nThe passion fruit panna cotta\n",
