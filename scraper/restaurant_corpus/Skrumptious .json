  "review": "So Skrumptious has moseyed a bit up Jawatta Road, to a large new location smack in the middle of Jawatta road. We swung by recently, and were pleasantly surprised by their spacious new area and the maintenance of quality.They've got a lot more than just brownies too, which makes this a legit dessert bar to some extent.\nThey also serve up\n, along with quality coffee, tea, milkshakes, and puddings. You can get their brownies served up ready to eat at their premises, take away, or packed en masse in cute boxes.\nOf course, we had to try the classics. We attempted one of their best sellers, the Fudgy Oreo Brownie (Rs. 550) and a rather recent addition to the menu, the Mocha Cream Cheese Brownie (Rs. 590). If it seems pricey it's because each comes as a stand-alone dish, two rather large bits of brownie topped with whipped cream, strawberries, and chocolate sauce.\nThe Oreo Brownie, which we had at the premises itself, was rather superb. It displayed that optimal inner gooeyness juxtaposed with outer crunchiness which every good brownie should have, and the lightness of the cream gave the dish a bit of texture. From my perspective, it's definitely a sharing dessert as it was pretty substantial.\nThe Mocha Cream Cheese wasn't as impressive. We had it take away, which may have compromised the texture a bit (it was about 40 degrees outside, or at least it felt like it). The brownie itself was superbly dense, so most of the people who tried it at YAMU HQ were convinced it was cookie dough flavoured - neither the mocha nor the cream cheese really came through. Overall, we didn't love it, but we finished it anyway.\nWe tried a Milo Shake too, which seemed a tad pricey at Rs. 400 but ended up totally worth it. It wasn't as cloying and thick as you'd expect a dessert shake to be, but it tasted lovely and rich enough anyway. There were oodles of whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top too, which offset the steady malt of the drink itself. A strong option, like a Milo packet for royalty.\nWe also tried a Chocolate Biscuit Pudding (about Rs. 300), in order to complete the perfect duo of Lankan cravings - Milo and CBP. It came conveniently pre-packaged in a medium plastic pudding cup.\nThis was a crowd favourite, and bringing it back to office was like introducing a pack of wolves to a pack of bacon. It was creamy and well-layered, overall a great and not overly sweet dessert option.\nThe service was very friendly and helpful, albeit not very fast. My brownie took a full 12 minutes to be served, which was strange because I assumed they were pre-made. I didn't really mind, as it gave me time to nose around the premises. There's one large room, a smaller ante-room, and a leafy outdoor seating area. Cosy cushioned couches, bright murals, and high chairs by the wall make for plenty of seating and an inviting area for chatting over a melty brownie sundae.\nMy one gripe was that there were a bunch of pesky flies buzzing about while we were there, which dampened the experience somewhat.\nOur experience at Skrumptious' new spot was overarchingly positive. They've clearly taken pains to ensure their quality has been consistent, but your enjoyment is going to be largely based on the dish choices you make (i.e: go for the classics and you'll leave happy). It's a bit pricey for some, but if you're sharing, it's a worthwhile dessert stop at a very central location. Given their comfortable crowd of customers on a weekday lunch, we don't doubt they'll do well.\nSkrumptious has introduced a new flavour to their lineup of brownies. We tried it, and it's pretty darn great.\nSkrumptious has introduced a new flavour to their lineup of brownies. We tried it, and it's pretty darn great.\n",
